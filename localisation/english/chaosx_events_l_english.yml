chaosx_welcome_intro_loc: "Thank you for playing our mod! Chaos Redux presents the ultimate strategic challenge, forcing you to navigate an increasingly unstable and unpredictable world that actively resists your control.\n\nAt the heart of the mod is the §YChaos Meter§!. As world tension, wars, deaths, and strange events push the meter higher, the world descends deeper into madness.\n\n§YDynamic & Evolving Events§!: The mod features a smart event system, through mechanisms like timer compression and adaptive weights. As chaos builds, events can §YEvolve§! into more severe forms, potentially culminating in §YWorld End Scenarios§! when the meter reaches critical levels.\n\nWe are always looking for feedback and suggestions. If you have any ideas or issues, please let us know on our Discord server!\n\n\n\n"
chaosx_core_event_system_loc: "§YCore Event System§!\n\nChaos Redux implements an adaptive event system that responds to player actions, world state, and previous events. The system uses weight-based probability, dynamic timing, and chaos-driven escalation to create an unpredictable and challenging experience.\n\n§YCore Principles§!\n\n- Dynamic Adaptation: Event frequency and selection adapt to current world state\n- Historical Memory: System tracks all fired events and adjusts future probabilities\n- Escalating Difficulty: Higher chaos levels increase event frequency and severity\n- Player Agency: Settings allow customization of system behavior\n\n"
chaosx_event_classification_loc: "§YEvent Classification§!\n\n§YFire-Once Events§!\n- Frequency: Trigger exactly once per campaign\n- Weight After Firing: Permanently set to 0\n- Purpose: Events that have a minor impact on the world at first, usually regional, but can become global.\n\n§YRepeatable Events§!\n- Frequency: Can fire multiple times with diminishing returns\n- Weight Recovery: +20 per month after firing\n- Cap Reduction: Maximum weight reduced by 50% each firing\n- Weight Progression: 1000 -> 500 -> 250 -> 125 -> 63 -> 32 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1\n- Purpose: Events that have a minor impact on the world and can be fired multiple times during a game.\n\n§YMajor Events§!\n- Initial State: Weight starts at 0 (inactive)\n- Activation: Weight increases by 150 per minor event fired\n- Firing Condition: Compete with other events based on accumulated weight\n- Weight After Firing: Permanently set to 0 for the fired event and all unfired major events reset to 0 weight\n- Purpose: Events that have a major impact on the world right away\n- Super Events: Major events are displayed as Super Events\n\n"
chaosx_timer_system_loc: "§YDynamic Timer System§!\n\nThe system uses a dynamic timer that replaces traditional fixed monthly intervals:\n\n- Daily Updates: Timer decreases by 1 each day\n- Event Trigger: When timer reaches 0, event selection begins\n- Base Range: 45-60 days between events (configurable)\n- Initial Timer: 7-30 days on game start\n\n§YTimer Acceleration§!\n\nEach minor event that fires:\n- Increases daily decrement by +1 (maximum: 35)\n- Makes subsequent events fire sooner\n- Effect accumulates across multiple minor events\n\nEvery 3 minor events:\n- Reduces maximum timer by 1 day (maximum reduction: 13 days)\n- Compresses the overall timer range\n- Creates faster event cycles during active periods\n\nWhen a major event fires:\n- Resets both decrement and compression to 0\n- Returns timer to standard 45-60 day range\n- Provides breathing room after significant events\n\n"
chaosx_chaos_meter_loc: "§YChaos Meter System§!\n\nA global meter (0-1000+) that tracks world instability and drives system behavior.\n\n§YChaos Tiers§!\n- Calm World (0-199): Normal event frequency, stable conditions\n- Gathering Storm (200-399): Slightly increased event frequency, some evolutions available\n- Rising Chaos (400-599): Moderately increased frequency, more evolutions available\n- Chaos Tier (600-799): High frequency, a lot event evolutions\n- Totalen Chaos (800-999): Very high frequency, most evolutions available\n- World Collapse (1000+): Maximum chaos, system prepares end-game scenarios\n\n"
chaosx_chaos_sources_loc: "§YChaos Sources§!\n\nMajor Increases:\n- Major power wars: +5 chaos\n- Major annexations: +10 chaos\n- Major power ideology changes to non-democratic: +5 chaos\n\nModerate Increases:\n- Minor power wars: +1 chaos\n- Minor annexations: +2 chaos\n- Puppeting: +1 to +3 chaos\n- Faction joining: +1 to +3 chaos\n- Nuke: +1 chaos (so it's not abused)\n- World tension increases: +1 per percentage point\n- Military buildup: +1 per 50 military factories or 100 divisions\n- Casualties: +1 per 250,000 casualties\n\nDecreases:\n- Peace agreements: -2 to -5 chaos\n- Liberation by democratic powers: -5 chaos\n- Freeing countries: -2 to -5 chaos\n- Faction leaving: -1 to -3 chaos\n- High world stability: variable reduction\n- Increased global democracy: variable reduction\n- Monthly Decay: -1\n\nChaos changes can also happen from events.\n\n"
chaosx_chaos_timing_loc: "§YChaos Effects on Timing§!\n\nEach chaos tier applies a multiplier to event timers:\n- Calm World: 1.0x (no change)\n- Gathering Storm: 0.8x (20% faster)\n- Rising Chaos: 0.7x (30% faster)\n- Chaos Tier: 0.6x (40% faster)\n- Totalen Chaos: 0.5x (50% faster)\n- World Collapse: 0.5x (events prepare for end-game)\n\n"
chaosx_world_end_loc: "§YWorld End Scenario Mechanic§!\n\nWhen the Chaos Meter exceeds 1000, the system triggers a World End Scenario.\nThis represents the logical conclusion of the campaign and prevents indefinite gameplay.\n\nKey Rules:\n- Trigger Condition: Chaos > 1000\n- Scenario Selection: Based on world state (e.g., zombie apocalypse if outbreak dominates, or other endgame disasters depending on conditions).\n- Event Freeze: Automatic event firing stops for all countries.\n- Purpose: Ensures campaigns reach a dramatic, conclusive end and prevents late-game slowdown.\n\n"
chaosx_event_evolution_loc: "§YEvent Evolution and Clusters§!\n\n§YEvent Evolution§!\nEvents can transform into more dangerous versions when chaos levels are sufficient:\n- Chaos Requirements: Different events evolve at different chaos thresholds\n- Progressive Escalation: Higher chaos enables more severe event variants\n- Prerequisite Events: Some evolutions require specific previous events\n\n§YEvent Clusters§!\nRelated events can fire in sequence:\n- Cluster Probability: Increases with higher chaos levels\n- Thematic Connections: Events within clusters share themes or consequences\n- Escalating Sequences: Later events in clusters tend to be more severe\n\n"

chaosx.nr1.1.t: "Communism Spread"
chaosx.nr1.1.d: "The ideology that advocates for a classless society where all property and wealth are collectively owned by the people has gained ground in Europe, Asia and beyond, challenging the dominance of capitalism and democracy."
chaosx.nr1.1.a: "A low class individual is not welcome in the Custerdome." 
chaosx.nr1.1.b: "A world where all is free!"

chaosx.nr1.2.t: "Communists are targeting our industry!"
chaosx.nr1.2.d: "The [Root.GetAdjective] Communist Party has launched a violent campaign to overthrow the government and establish a socialist republic. They have targeted and destroyed public and private buildings, such as banks, factories, churches, and government offices. They have also fought with the police and the army, who are trying to suppress the revolt.\n\nThe government, led by [Root.GetLeader], has ignored the strength and popularity of the communists. The situation is critical, as the communists are advancing and gaining support. They are threatening to take over the capital, [Root.Capital.GetName], and the rest of the country. The government is facing a crisis of legitimacy and authority, as it tries to restore order and democracy."
chaosx.nr1.2.a: "With a cough, I shake it off"
chaosx.nr1.2.b: "Suppress the revolt"
chaosx_tt_1_2a: "Damage to buildings and loss of population in state(s)."

chaosx.nr1.3.t: "Communist Uprising"
chaosx.nr1.3.d: "The low stability of our government has emboldened the communist sympathizers in our country. They have organized massive worker strikes and protests, demanding a radical change in the political system. We have three options: we can stall and buy ourselves some time, or we can either try to suppress the uprising with force, risking further unrest and violence, or we can give in to their demands and embrace communism, losing our ideals and allies."
chaosx.nr1.3.a: "Buy some time"
chaosx.nr1.3.b: "Start a civil war"
chaosx.nr1.3.c: "No more pain and no regrets"

# Communist influence change events
chaosx.nr1.4.t: "Communist Influence Growing"
chaosx.nr1.4.d: "Reports from across the nation indicate that communist sentiment is gaining strength among the working class. More citizens are attending party meetings, and pro-communist literature is being distributed in factories and universities. The local authorities are concerned about this growing revolutionary fervor."
chaosx.nr1.4.a: "We must keep a watchful eye on this development"

chaosx.nr1.5.t: "Communist Influence Weakening"
chaosx.nr1.5.d: "Recent government actions and improved economic conditions have led to a noticeable decline in communist support. Fewer people are attending party rallies, and several prominent communist leaders have been arrested or have fled the country. The threat of revolution seems to be diminishing."
chaosx.nr1.5.a: "Our efforts are paying off"

chaosx.nr1.6.t: "Communist Threat Reaches Critical Level"
chaosx.nr1.6.d: "The communist movement has reached unprecedented levels of support and organization. Revolutionary committees are being formed in major cities, and there are reports of weapons being stockpiled by party militants. The situation has become extremely dangerous for our government's stability."
chaosx.nr1.6.a: "This is a dire threat to our nation"

chaosx.nr1.7.t: "Communist Threat Greatly Reduced"
chaosx.nr1.7.d: "Through decisive action and careful policy, we have successfully curtailed the communist threat. Party membership has plummeted, and their organizational structure has been largely dismantled. The people have regained confidence in our government and rejected the revolutionary ideology."
chaosx.nr1.7.a: "Our nation is safer now"

# Communist rebel uprising event
chaosx.nr1.8.t: "Communist Rebels Seize Territory"
chaosx.nr1.8.d: "Organized communist rebel groups have emerged across the country, taking advantage of the growing chaos and instability. The scale of their uprising depends on the strength of communist support in our nation - the higher their popularity, the more territory they will seize. With stability declining, they are also fielding more divisions per occupied area."
chaosx.nr1.8.b: "We will crush this rebellion!"
chaosx.nr1.8.c: "Perhaps we should listen to their demands..."

chaosx.nr1.9.t: "Military Intervention Successful"
chaosx.nr1.9.d: "Our military intervention against communist cells has proven successful. Security forces have effectively dismantled several communist networks, arrested key organizers, and confiscated weapons and propaganda materials. The operation was executed with precision, minimizing civilian casualties while significantly weakening the communist movement. The relatively low level of communist support in our nation made it easier for our forces to identify and neutralize threats. Public support for law and order has increased, though some stability has been compromised due to the heavy-handed nature of the operation."
chaosx.nr1.9.a: "Order has been restored"

chaosx.nr1.10.t: "Military Intervention Partially Successful"
chaosx.nr1.10.d: "Our military intervention against communist cells has yielded mixed results. While security forces managed to disrupt some communist activities and make several arrests, many key figures escaped and significant portions of their network remain intact. The operation faced unexpected resistance, particularly in areas with stronger communist sympathy among the population. Some equipment was lost in the confrontations, and the communist movement has been weakened but not eliminated. Both stability and war support have suffered due to the operation's limitations and the challenges posed by widespread communist support."
chaosx.nr1.10.a: "At least we made some progress"

chaosx.nr1.11.t: "Military Intervention Failed"
chaosx.nr1.11.d: "Our military intervention against communist cells has ended in complete failure. Security forces were outmaneuvered by well-organized communist networks that enjoyed significant popular support, making intelligence gathering nearly impossible and hampering operations at every turn. The high level of communist sympathy among the population resulted in significant casualties and equipment losses for our forces. Several high-ranking officers were captured or killed, and the operation has been perceived as a humiliating defeat. The communist movement has gained considerable propaganda value from this failure, using our defeat to attract new recruits and demonstrate the strength of their cause. Our government's credibility and the military's reputation have suffered severe damage."
chaosx.nr1.11.a: "This is a disaster..."

chaosx.nr2.7.d: "Major world powers have announced the formation of the Anti Zombie League, a military alliance dedicated to combating the growing zombie threat. The league seeks to coordinate global efforts against the undead menace and pool resources for the development and distribution of anti-zombie measures.\n\n[From.GetAdjective] representatives have extended an invitation for us to join this coalition. Membership would require implementing outbreak prevention protocols and participating in cure research sharing, but would also provide access to enhanced protection measures and coordinated military support.\n\nThe zombie forces currently field approximately [?total_zombie_divisions] divisions across their territories."
