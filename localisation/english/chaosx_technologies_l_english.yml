fail_safe_containment_facilities_desc: "Purpose-built containment complexes with fail-safe isolation measures. Stockpile accidents are prevented entirely.\n\nBioweapon stockpile lab accidents: §GImpossible§!."

# Livens Projector Technologies
livens_projector_tech: "Livens Projector"
livens_projector_tech_desc: "Captain William Livens developed this simple but effective mortar-like weapon in 1916. The Livens projector can launch large drums filled with chemical agents up to 1,500 meters, providing a more concentrated chemical attack than traditional gas cylinder releases."

improved_livens_projector: "Improved Livens Projector"
improved_livens_projector_desc: "Enhanced Livens projector design with better electrical firing mechanisms and improved range. These improvements were developed during 1918 after extensive battlefield experience showed the weapon's effectiveness."

advanced_livens_projector: "Advanced Livens Projector"  
advanced_livens_projector_desc: "Modern refinements to the Livens projector system using improved materials and precision manufacturing. These advanced projectors offer superior reliability and accuracy for chemical warfare operations."

# Choking Agents
chlorine_gas: "Chlorine Gas"
chlorine_gas_desc: "One of the first chemical weapons used in World War I. Chlorine gas causes severe respiratory damage and was first deployed by German forces in 1915 at the Second Battle of Ypres."

phosgene: "Phosgene"
phosgene_desc: "A highly toxic choking agent that was responsible for about 85% of chemical weapon deaths in World War I. Phosgene is more deadly than chlorine but less detectable."

# Blister Agents
mustard_gas: "Mustard Gas"
mustard_gas_desc: "A powerful chemical weapon that causes severe chemical burns and blistering. First used by Germany in 1917, mustard gas became one of the most feared weapons of World War I."

lewisite: "Lewisite"
lewisite_desc: "An organoarsenic chemical weapon developed near the end of World War I. Lewisite causes immediate pain and tissue damage, making it both a blister and systemic agent."

# Gas Masks
basic_gas_masks: "Gas Masks"
basic_gas_masks_desc: "Basic protective equipment designed to filter out chemical agents. These early gas masks provide essential protection against chlorine and phosgene gases, though their effectiveness is limited.\n\nChemical attack mitigation: §G25%§!."

improved_gas_masks: "Improved Gas Masks" 
improved_gas_masks_desc: "Enhanced gas masks with better sealing, improved filters, and more comfortable designs. These masks offer superior protection against a wider range of chemical agents.\n\nChemical attack mitigation: §G50%§!."

advanced_gas_masks: "Advanced Gas Masks"
advanced_gas_masks_desc: "State-of-the-art protective equipment featuring advanced filtration systems and ergonomic designs. These masks provide comprehensive protection against all known chemical warfare agents.\n\nChemical attack mitigation: §G75%§!."

# Wind Detection
portable_anemometer: "Portable Anemometers"
portable_anemometer_desc: "Compact handheld anemometers and simple field procedures standardized for frontline releases. Basic wind readouts reduce forecast errors and slightly improve favorable conditions.\n\nWind forecast: §G+3% favorable§!.\nMiscalculation chance: §G-0.5%§!."

meteorological_stations: "Meteorological Stations"
meteorological_stations_desc: "Dedicated weather stations and trained observers feeding updated wind maps. Improved readings raise favorable odds and introduce rare strongly favorable conditions.\n\nWind forecast: §G+6% favorable§!, §G2% strongly favorable§!.\nMiscalculation chance: §G-1%§!."

upper_air_soundings: "Upper-Air Soundings"
upper_air_soundings_desc: "Balloon soundings and coordinated reports give precise upper-air data for release windows. Favorable odds improve further.\n\nWind forecast: §G+9% favorable§!, §G4% strongly favorable§!.\nMiscalculation chance: §G-1.5%§!."
