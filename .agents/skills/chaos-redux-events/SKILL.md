# Chaos Redux Events

Use this skill for any Chaos Redux event work, including:

- adding or updating `chaosx.nr<ID>.*` event chains
- wiring event log, event details, evolutions, and world-end branches
- maintaining `docs/events/` event documentation
- updating the gameplay-facing event spreadsheet

Repository-wide reading, style, and validation rules live in `AGENTS.md`. This skill only adds the Chaos Redux event-specific implementation contract.

## Working model

In Chaos Redux, an event is not just an event block.

Treat every event as a contract across some or all of these surfaces:

- event definition and subevents
- random-event classification and registration
- auto-fire or runtime hooks
- shared scripted effects, scripted triggers, and script constants
- event-name and debug-name mappings
- event log names, actor mapping, event-details content, and evolution views
- super-event image, localisation, and audio wiring
- decisions, ideas, AI, characters, unit templates, or special-country handling
- `docs/events/` documentation and spreadsheet

If a task seems to need custom one-off plumbing, first check whether the same behavior should become generic for future events.

## Event anatomy

- entry event: the canonical `chaosx.nr<ID>.1` start
- player-facing popup events: the things the player actually reads and clicks
- follow-up/news events: broadcast or consequence popups
- evolutions: milestone states inside the same event identity
- world-end scenarios and super-events
- connection with other events (meaning that events are not standalone and actually interact with each other)

## What evolutions are

In Chaos Redux, an evolution is a meaningful milestone inside one event's lifecycle that the player should be able to understand as part of the same story/mechanic.

Evolutions usually should not replace the core behavior of an event. The default design direction is that evolutions add uncertainty, rare variants, new narrative texture, and controlled escalation while keeping the original event identity readable.

Typical examples of evolutions:

- unlocking a new path (for example in a focus tree)
- a threat becoming less predictable
- rare surprise outcomes becoming possible
- new incidents, side events, or variants appearing
- a stronger but still bounded version of an existing consequence
- a branch changing severity, scale, or behavior without rewriting the whole system
- a system gaining stranger flavor, new atmosphere, or new event hooks

Use evolutions to add spice and instability before using them to create a new gameplay phase. A new phase is valid only when the event genuinely needs it and the user asked for that level of escalation.

Evolution design rules:

- Keep the parent event's core loop intact unless the task explicitly asks for a full phase change.
- Prefer rare surprises over constant spam.
- Keep consequences scaled to the target country or world state.
- Use cooldowns and pacing so evolved incidents feel notable.
- Make each evolution understandable in the event log and evolution view.
- Evolution rows and event-detail preview rows should display the specific stage/evolution title, not the generic evolution type label, except as fallback text.
- Document what new rare outcomes or variants the evolution unlocks.

### Evolution implementation

The usual pattern is:

1. the evolution MTTH event becomes available
2. set the shared evolution context variables
3. record the evolution log entry through the shared pipeline
4. Event evolutions that gate content must respect the enable/disable UI. If an evolution is disabled, the gated path must have a clean alternate unlock instead of staying blocked forever.

The shared context is:

- `events_log_evolution_event_id`
- `events_log_evolution_type`
- `events_log_evolution_stage`
- `events_log_evolution_tier`
- `events_log_evolution_actor` when the stage belongs to a country

Then:

- gate the stage with `is_current_evolution_enabled = yes` only if the stage should be disableable from the UI
- call `record_events_log_evolution_entry = yes`

Design rules:

- `event_id` ties the evolution to the parent event
- `type` separates parallel tracks inside the same event if needed
- `stage` should increase cleanly inside one type
- `tier` is display-oriented; do not use it as a substitute for real logic state

## World-end scenarios

A world-end scenario is a terminal branch that changes the campaign into a resolved or end-state condition, not just a large disaster or strong major event. World-end scenario is chosen based on the world state. World-end scenario can only be triggered when the chaos value is over 1000.

### World-end scenario implementation

The normal contract is:

1. guard the branch with `NOT = { has_global_flag = world_end }`
2. set `world_end`
3. set a scenario-specific global flag
4. set the matching `super_event_visible`
5. update the matching super-event text, image, and audio wiring
6. stop or gate incompatible future systems and branches
7. document the end-state in the event doc, and spreadsheet

## Major-event defeat aftermath

Some major events should also have a structured aftermath when the threat is beaten.

Use a defeat aftermath package when all of these are true:

- the defeated threat was global or near-global in reach
- the campaign lasted long enough to feel like a world crisis
- the cost in casualties, destruction, or political disruption was high enough that the world should not simply snap back to normal

Typical aftermath content:

- a defeat super-event or defeat-stage super-event effect
- postwar treaties, compacts, or new world orders
- recurring remembrance, reconstruction, or vigilance events
- lasting ideas, tech-sharing groups, or diplomatic rules that exist because the world learned from the crisis

Do not add a treaty/new world order after every contained or short-lived disaster. Those only make sense when the event genuinely reshaped the campaign.

## Event implementation workflow

### 1. Classify the event first

- Entry events keep the format `chaosx.nr<ID>.1`.
- Keep related subevents in the same namespace.
- Decide whether the event belongs in:
  - `global.major_events`
  - `global.repeatable_events`
  - `global.fire_once_events`
- Decide which pieces are:
  - hidden bootstrap/runtime events
  - player-facing popup events
  - news follow-ups
  - evolution/escalation events
  - world-end or super-event branches

Keep IDs stable when updating existing chains.

### 2. Map touched systems before editing

Always start from the event and walk outward through the systems it touches.

Core files to check:

- `events/XXX_my_event.txt`
- `common/on_actions/chaosx_on_actions_system.txt`
- `common/scripted_effects/chaosx_logic_effects.txt`
- `localisation/english/chaosx_event_names_l_english.yml`
- `localisation/english/chaosx_events_l_english.yml`
- `common/scripted_localisation/chaosx_scripted_localisation_debug.txt`
- `common/scripted_localisation/chaosx_scripted_localisation_events_log.txt`

Frequently-needed companion files:

- `common/on_actions/chaosx_on_actions.txt`
- `common/scripted_effects/chaosx_settings_effects.txt`
- `common/scripted_guis/chaosx_scripted_gui_events_log.txt`
- `common/scripted_guis/chaosx_scripted_gui_settings.txt`
- `common/scripted_guis/chaosx_scripted_gui_super_events.txt`
- `interface/chaosx_events_log_popup.gui`
- `interface/chaosx_super_events.gfx`
- `common/scripted_localisation/chaosx_scripted_localisation_super_events.txt`
- `localisation/english/chaosx_gui_l_english.yml`
- `common/script_constants/*.txt`
- `common/scripted_triggers/*.txt`
- `common/scripted_effects/*.txt`
- `common/decisions/*.txt`
- `common/decisions/categories/*.txt`
- `common/ideas/*.txt`
- `common/ai_strategy/*.txt`
- `common/ai_templates/*.txt`
- and possibly more. Some events truly can touch all systems.

If the event creates or manages non-standard countries (like special chaos countries and non-human countries), then account for that as well. Events interact with each other, so events that usually affect normal countries (like black plague or mass panic), shouldn't for example affect zombie or alien countries.

Country-specific or tag-specific events must have a reusable valid-target trigger before they enter selection or manual firing. If the required country does not exist, the event should show `N/A` in the event list and must not queue a delayed event against the missing tag. For example, the Holy Realm checks for Tibet first, then Bhutan or Nepal only if Tibet is gone.

### 3. Register the event in the random-event system

Update the event system registration in the same change.

Required checks:

1. Add or keep the event ID in the correct array inside `initialize_event_categories`.
2. Keep the event classification aligned with the actual gameplay behavior.
3. Make sure `get_event_type` can resolve the ID through the registered arrays.
4. Keep debug/event-log name mappings aligned with the registered ID.

Do not add an event script and leave the event system unaware of it.

### 4. Handle supporting gameplay systems

An event always needs more than its own script file.

Touch the relevant systems in the same change:

- decisions and categories if the event creates player tools, responses, or for example containment mechanics
- ideas or dynamic modifiers if the event creates persistent gameplay state
- AI strategies or templates if the event changes how AI should respond
- special-country exclusions if the event touches broad civilian, political, migration, or ideology systems
- and much more

If you add a new reusable dynamic scripted effect (an effect that could be generalized for all events), document it in `common/scripted_effects/chaosx_dynamic_effects.md` in the same change.

### 5. Event log integration

Events must appear in Chaos Redux’s event log, wire the full log contract in the same change.

Required name plumbing:

- add or update visible event-name loc in `localisation/english/chaosx_event_names_l_english.yml`
- update event-name selectors in `common/scripted_localisation/chaosx_scripted_localisation_events_log.txt`
- update debug-name selectors in `common/scripted_localisation/chaosx_scripted_localisation_debug.txt`

Required actor plumbing when a flag should appear:

- update `events_log_set_default_actor_for_current_event` in `common/scripted_effects/chaosx_logic_effects.txt`
- use a default actor only when the event should show a meaningful actor before or without a fired history row
- if fired history should override the default actor, keep the history-context flow intact

Required detail-view plumbing:

- update the event-details text selectors in `common/scripted_localisation/chaosx_scripted_localisation_events_log.txt`
- update the actual user-facing text in `localisation/english/chaosx_gui_l_english.yml`
- if new generic event-log behavior is needed, wire it through:
  - `common/scripted_effects/chaosx_settings_effects.txt`
  - `common/scripted_guis/chaosx_scripted_gui_events_log.txt`
  - `interface/chaosx_events_log_popup.gui`

Do not hardcode one-off GUI behavior if it should be reusable by later events.

### 6. Event cluster integration

Event clusters are a catalogue layer above normal random events. The Clusters tab must show every registered cluster, while History shows only clusters that actually fired.

Core files:

- `common/script_constants/event_cluster_constants.txt`
- `common/scripted_effects/chaosx_event_cluster_effects.txt`
- `common/scripted_effects/chaosx_settings_effects.txt` when log/settings view state changes
- `common/scripted_guis/chaosx_scripted_gui_events_log.txt` when cluster log UI behavior changes
- `interface/chaosx_events_log_popup.gui` when cluster list/details layout changes
- `common/scripted_localisation/chaosx_scripted_localisation_events_log.txt`
- `common/scripted_localisation/chaosx_scripted_localisation_settings.txt`
- `localisation/english/chaosx_gui_l_english.yml`

To add a new cluster:

1. Add an ID in `event_cluster_id`.
2. Add any cluster-specific tuning group, for example `event_cluster_<slug> = { unlock_tier cooldown_days }`.
3. Register the cluster in `initialize_event_cluster_definitions` by pushing aligned entries into `global.event_clusters`, `global.event_cluster_type_entries`, and `global.event_cluster_unlock_tier_entries`.
4. Map member events in `event_belongs_to_cluster`, from normal event ID to cluster ID.
5. Add ordered member rows in `load_event_cluster_members`.
6. Add or update cluster name/type/description scripted localisation and GUI localisation.
7. If it needs custom runtime setup, add that branch to `event_cluster_prepare_runtime_context`.
8. If it needs a custom cooldown or one-time state, update `mark_event_cluster_fired_state` and any availability logic in `can_event_cluster_fire`.

Member attributes are parallel arrays in `load_event_cluster_members`:

- `temp_event_cluster_member_event_id_entries`: normal event ID.
- `temp_event_cluster_member_role_entries`: `event_cluster_member_role.required` or `event_cluster_member_role.optional`.
- `temp_event_cluster_member_chance_entries`: participation chance for optional members, usually from `event_cluster_member_participation`.
- `temp_event_cluster_member_min_tier_entries`: minimum chaos tier for that member.
- `temp_event_cluster_member_danger_entries`: display severity in cluster details.

To change a member's behavior, edit those attributes together. Do not reorder one array without the others.

Cluster firing rules:

- Automatic cluster firing happens from `try_fire_event_cluster_for_selected_event` after a member event is selected.
- Automatic firing respects cluster unlock tier, cooldown, one-time state, member eligibility, optional participation rolls, and runtime context.
- Manual firing from Settings uses `force_fire_event_cluster_by_temp_id`; it bypasses tier, cooldown, disabled-state, and member availability checks. Runtime context can still fail if the event cannot build the required scopes.
- Cluster history rows are recorded by `record_events_log_cluster_entry`; cluster catalogue rows are rebuilt by `rebuild_events_log_cluster_view`.

Cluster UI rules:

- The Clusters tab is a catalogue, not a fired-history list.
- Fired clusters belong in History and should open the same cluster details window as catalogue rows.
- Keep cluster sort/filter controls, row text, details layout, and localisation in sync when adding new cluster attributes.

### 7. Duration fields and constants

Use `script_constants` for shared tuning, but remember that some duration fields reject both `constant:` and variable tokens.

Known sensitive fields:

- `set_country_flag = { days = ... }`
- `set_global_flag = { days = ... }`
- any other timed field that throws `Malformed token` for either `constant:category.key` or a variable token

For those fields, use a file-scoped `@NAME = literal` constant in the same script file and pass `days = @NAME`. Keep the value mirrored with the matching `common/script_constants/` tuning entry, and update both in the same change.

Do not work around this by setting a temp variable and passing `days = temp_name`; those fields can reject variable tokens too.

### 8. Super-event integration

If the event shows or drives a super event, wire the whole package:

- choose the slot intentionally
- set `super_event_visible`
- set `global.current_super_event_audio_id`. Every super event has a unique audio. Copy an existing audio and use it as placeholder, so that I can replace it with the real track later.
- use the settings-aware playback helper rather than bypassing it
- update scripted localisation in `common/scripted_localisation/chaosx_scripted_localisation_super_events.txt`
- update image wiring in `interface/chaosx_super_events.gfx`
- update player-facing localisation in the correct `.yml` files
- also update the .html documentation of music files correctly. If you can't get all the info from the file metadata and the user didn't provide the author or the name of the piece, then ask the user to do so.

Use `chaos-redux-super-events` whenever an event includes a super-event.

That skill handles super-event title direction, description tone, quote research, cultural remark selection, audio research, source documentation, and super-event presentation rules.

This skill handles implementation wiring: slot, flags, localisation, image, audio ID, scripted localisation, `.gfx`, docs, and spreadsheet updates.

### 9. World-end integration

If the event can produce a terminal scenario:

- keep the world-end flagging explicit and centralized
- make sure the terminal branch is distinguishable from ordinary major-event escalation
- gate later random events, branches, or systems that should no longer operate after the terminal state
- make the event log, docs, and spreadsheet, all agree on what the terminal branch actually is

If the branch is dramatic but not actually terminal, treat it as a major escalation evolution or super-event instead of world-end.

### World threat framework

If an event or mechanic creates an existential external threat that should push other systems toward cooperation, integrate it with the shared world-threat framework instead of inventing a new one-off flag.

Current shared state:

- aggregate flag: `world_in_threat`
- source-count variable: `global.world_threat_source_count`
- current source flag: `world_threat_source_zombies`

Implementation pattern:

1. create or reuse a threat-specific source flag
2. write a threat-specific refresh effect that sets or clears that source flag from real gameplay conditions
3. update `refresh_world_threat_state` in `common/scripted_effects/chaosx_dynamic_effects.txt`
4. expose reusable scripted triggers if other systems should read the new source directly
5. document the threat source in the mechanic doc

Do not create a parallel global "cooperation crisis" or "threat active" flag for a single event chain. Everything should fold back into `world_in_threat`.
The exact purpose of that flag is not yet planned.

## Documentation rules

Event-specific documentation belongs in `docs/events/`.

Preferred naming pattern:

- `docs/events/<zero_padded_id>_<slug>.md`, so exactly like with event script files.

Keep one canonical doc per event chain instead of splitting mechanics across multiple top-level docs unless the user explicitly asks for that.

Event doc structure:

1. What the event is.
2. Event map and subevents.
3. Trigger and runtime flow.
4. Main gameplay effects.
5. Supporting systems touched.
6. AI behavior if relevant.
7. Evolutions and escalation flow if relevant.
8. World-end and super-event integration if relevant.
9. Connections with other events if relevant.
10. Asset wiring and sprite expectations if relevant.
11. Limitations if any.
12. Open tuning notes and future expansion ideas.

### Docs and gameplay must stay aligned

When mechanics change, update the matching event doc in the same change.

Do not leave the doc describing:

- old triggers
- old cooldowns
- old stage counts
- removed branches
- removed assets
- outdated spreadsheet or deck expectations

## Event catalog spreadsheet

Maintain the gameplay-facing event table in:

- `docs/spreadsheets/chaos_redux_events_catalog.xlsx`

Rules:

- use the `xlsx` skill
- write for players, not script readers
- focus on what happens in play
- keep the `Details` field aligned with the event-details window description
- keep evolution/world-end columns aligned with the real chain structure

## Event presentation workflow

Use this when the user asks for event slides, a showcase deck, or presentation updates.

Required tools and order:

1. `pptx`
2. `theme-factory`
3. `canvas-design`
4. LaTeX rendering when formulas or gameplay math need to be shown clearly

Visual standard:

- minimalistic
- stark
- propaganda-poster energy
- 1984-inspired restraint
- strong contrast
- deliberate negative space
- bold composition
- no generic corporate deck styling

Rules:

- every slide gets original event-specific art
- evolutions should visibly evolve
- terminal branches should get heavier final-slide treatment
- keep deck path and asset folder stable unless the user asks otherwise

Preferred deck path:

- `docs/presentations/chaos_redux_events.pptx`

## Generated asset handling

Use the `chaos-redux-event-assets` skill whenever an event task requires generated or processed visual assets.

For every generated asset:

1. Generate the base artwork through the configured image generation MCP.
2. Save the original generated image as a source PNG.
3. Create a processed PNG preview at the correct HOI4 target size.
4. Convert the processed PNG to DDS 32 bit unsigned BGRB 8.8.8.8.
5. Move the DDS into the correct mod asset folder.
6. Add or update the matching sprite definition in the correct `.gfx` file.
7. Update localisation, docs, and event spreadsheet entries that reference the asset.
8. Record the asset in a markdown manifest.

The asset manifest must include:

- asset name
- asset type
- source PNG path
- processed PNG path
- final DDS path
- target size
- sprite name
- intended in-game use
- related event id
- notes

Do not leave generated assets only in a temporary folder. If the event uses them, wire them into the mod.

## Final event checklist

Before closing an event task, verify:

1. Event script is updated.
2. Event classification/registration arrays are updated.
3. Auto-firing or runtime hooks are updated if needed.
4. Shared effects, triggers, and constants are updated if needed.
5. Event-name and debug-name mappings are updated.
6. Event log actor mapping is updated if needed.
7. Event details window content is updated if the event appears there.
8. Evolution logging and preview wiring are updated if relevant.
9. If the event has a super-event, `chaos-redux-super-events` has been used for quote, remark, audio, and presentation planning.
10. Supporting decisions, ideas, AI, country setup, or exclusions are updated if relevant.
11. `docs/events/` is updated.
12. `docs/spreadsheets/chaos_redux_events_catalog.xlsx` is updated.
13. If assets are required, `chaos-redux-event-assets` has been used.
14. Generated assets are resized, converted to DDS 32 bit unsigned BGRB 8.8.8.8, moved into the correct folders, wired in `.gfx`, and recorded in an asset manifest.
