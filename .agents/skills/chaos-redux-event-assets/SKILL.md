# Chaos Redux Event Assets

Use this skill when a Chaos Redux task requires final visual assets.

This includes event assets, UI assets, focus tree assets, country assets, achievement assets, generated icons, sourced event art, generated icon art, animated sprites, animated portraits, sprite sheets, GIF previews, and any asset package that must be wired into the mod.

## 1. Core purpose

The goal is to turn asset needs from an event spec into real HOI4-ready files.

The asset workflow must produce:

- source artwork
- processed PNG previews
- final DDS files
- correct file placement
- sprite handoff notes for the main agent
- documentation of what was created

Do not leave assets as loose generated or downloaded images.

If an asset is used by the event, it must be processed, placed, documented, and handed off so the main agent can wire it cleanly.

## 2. When to use this skill

Use this skill for:

- event pictures
- report event pictures
- news event pictures
- super-event images
- decision icons
- decision category icons
- static and animated decision category pictures
- idea icons
- national spirit icons
- officer corps spirit icons
- focus icons
- achievement icons
- flags
- country leader, commander, and operative portraits
- explicitly authorized advisor, theorist, and high-command dossier portraits
- intelligence-agency and intelligence-operation icons
- commander-trait, medal, military-raid, state-modifier, MIO, faction, building, and modifier icons
- land, naval, and air equipment art, counters, emblems, and 3D unit visual references
- faction emblems
- UI panels
- progression-state variants
- animated sprites
- animated UI pieces
- animated leader portraits
- sprite sheets and GIF previews for review
- any other static or animated visual asset required by a Chaos Redux event or mechanic

Asset-type coverage is authorization-bounded. Do not infer a custom asset only because the corresponding gameplay object exists. Create an asset family only when an accepted spec row, asset manifest row, or explicit user instruction requests it. Apply the same rule to optional portraits, route emblems, animation, and other asset families not present in the accepted requirement set.

Never infer an advisor, high-command, officer-corps, dossier-card, or other small-portrait family from a character, idea, trait, or `portraits = { ... }` consumer. Create that family only when the accepted requirement explicitly asks for it, otherwise leave the family absent and report the authorization boundary.

Use this skill when the user asks the agent to create, source, process, or wire final visual assets.

Use this skill when the implementation task includes generated, sourced, or user-provided PNG files that must be turned into HOI4-ready assets.

Use `chaos-redux-frame-animation` together with this skill when an asset needs animation. Animated final assets must come from planned source frames, not from moving, scaling, rotating, warping, blurring, recoloring, or filtering one still image.


## 2.1 Custom subagent split

When actual files must be created, route the work through narrow project subagents instead of one broad asset worker.

The main agent decides which subagent to spawn, gives it a bounded asset prompt, reviews the output, and performs final wiring.

Use:

- `chaosx_asset_source_researcher` for non-portrait real or archival image sourcing, historical flag-design research, historically attested symbols, user-provided source photos, archival decision category pictures, and report/news/super-event images that must depict real photographed material
- `chaosx_portrait_creator` for every character portrait: grounded source research, durable archival storage, crops and placeholders, fictional native ImageGen production, user-supplied styled-result validation, processing, DDS conversion, portrait-specific wiring, manifests, and handoffs
- `chaosx_generated_event_art` for generated non-icon event art, including fictional or alternate-history report images, news images, super-event images, explicitly authorized fictional advisor masters, ImageGen-created flat flag designs, faction emblems, UI panels, generated decision category pictures, and progression-state base art. It does not own final character portraits.
- `chaosx_icon_artist` for focus, idea, national-spirit, officer-corps, decision, decision-category, mission, achievement, technology, intelligence-agency, intelligence-operation, commander-trait, medal, military-raid, state-modifier, MIO, faction, building, modifier icons, and exact state-piece graphics derived from verified map geometry

Flags are a flat graphic-design pipeline, not event artwork. Historical flag research establishes the documented geometry, colours, and symbols, ImageGen still produces the final clean flat design under section 20.

For animated work, route by asset type first. Then require the chosen asset subagent to follow `chaos-redux-frame-animation` for frame plans, per-frame source art, normalization, contact sheets, preview GIFs, frame sheets, static fallbacks, and animation handoffs.

Asset subagents may create:

- source files
- processed PNG previews
- final DDS files
- contact sheets
- manifests
- durable portrait source masters under `docs/assets/portraits/`
- `docs/assets/<event_id>_<event_slug>/gfx_handoff.md`

Asset subagents must not edit `.gfx`, localisation, GUI, event, focus, idea, decision, scripted effect, scripted trigger, on_action, history, country, or spreadsheet files unless the parent explicitly grants that scope. The portrait worker has a standing narrow exception for portrait-specific `.gfx` entries and existing character portrait references.

Every new custom unit or subunit requires bespoke counter art for every runtime counter surface it uses. Before production, inspect the exact installed-vanilla counter definition and DDS plus the matching skill-local family under `assets/vanilla_reference/units/`. Match the sampled vanilla green palette, canvas, frame order, alpha/background treatment, border, silhouette, shading, contrast, and state behavior. Reused counters, renamed existing counters, generic placeholders, arbitrary green, and final art made without recorded vanilla inspection are forbidden. Route production to `chaosx_icon_artist`, block when the exact references are unavailable.

The main agent owns final non-portrait `.gfx` sprite definitions, gameplay references, docs alignment, spreadsheet alignment, and validation. The portrait worker owns portrait-specific `.gfx` and existing character portrait references. When an asset change requires catalog alignment, update only the authoritative XLSX and run `python .tools/export_event_catalog_csv.py`, the three CSV files are export-only and must not be edited directly.

A good parent prompt to an asset subagent includes the event id, asset list, asset type, target size, source mode, final DDS folder, sprite name if already registered, reference folder, visual direction, source constraints, and anything the subagent must mark blocked instead of substituting.

For one-person country-leader or officeholder portraits, the parent prompt must also state the polity's identity classification and the reason the selected source mode is allowed. Use the portrait source-mode gate in section 3: grounded identities are sourced, while generated one-person portraits are reserved for truly fictional high-chaos countries or impossible/supernatural entities. Agents must fail closed when that classification or source evidence is missing, contradictory, or unsupported.


## 2.2 Final asset placement and naming

Event-owned final assets should be grouped under an event-scoped folder whenever the engine surface uses explicit sprite or texture paths.

Use this folder form:

```text
<event_id>_<event_slug>
```

Place the event folder directly under the asset category folder, for example `gfx/event_pictures/014_cannibalism/` or `gfx/interface/ideas/014_cannibalism/`. Do not insert a project namespace layer such as `gfx/event_pictures/chaos_redux/014_cannibalism/`, the mod root already provides the project namespace.

Do not leave new event assets loose in category roots such as `gfx/event_pictures/`, `gfx/super_events/`, `gfx/interface/ideas/`, `gfx/interface/goals/`, `gfx/interface/decisions/`, or `gfx/leaders/` unless that root placement is an engine-facing lookup requirement.

Root-only and engine-convention exceptions:

- `gfx/achievements/` must keep achievement DDS files directly in the root. Do not create `gfx/achievements/<event_id>_<event_slug>/` subfolders unless a new engine behavior has been verified locally. Achievement filenames must match the full achievement ids from `common/achievements/`, so event-owned achievement ids and triplet filenames should use `<event_id>_<event_slug>_<achievement_name>{,_grey,_not_eligible}.dds` or the exact established id if it includes an ordinal.
- `gfx/flags/`, `gfx/flags/medium/`, and `gfx/flags/small/` must keep HOI4 tag/ideology filenames. Do not put flags into event folders, use cosmetic tags or route-specific tag filenames when an event needs transformed flags.

Shared or non-event systems may use a clear shared/system folder. Do not force shared assets into an event folder just to avoid a root directory.

When moving or adding an asset, update every `.gfx`, `.gui`, event, idea, decision, focus, localisation, and documentation reference that names the old path or sprite. Keep sprite names stable unless the engine-facing identifier itself has to change, as with achievement ids.

Super-event audio follows the `chaos-redux-super-events` convention. Register the final cue as sound from `sound/<event_id>_<event_slug>/super_event_<super_event_id>_<super_event_name>.wav`. Preserve source downloads under docs/assets source-audio paths.

## 2.3 Temporary event asset workspaces

Treat `docs/assets/<event_id>_<event_slug>/` as a temporary, event-scoped working and evidence folder, not as a shipped asset library. Use it during active implementation for source files, processed previews, contact sheets, prompts, provenance, manifests, animation plans and previews, source-audio downloads, and handoff notes. Keep it while the event is active, blocked, awaiting review, or undergoing acceptance scenarios.

Before declaring the event goal fully complete:

1. Confirm that every accepted asset row has a final runtime consumer and that no runtime reference points into `docs/assets/`.
2. Promote durable provenance, licensing, attribution, requirement-to-runtime crosswalks, review results, accepted handoff facts, and blocker or exception notes into permanent `docs/events/`, `docs/plans/`, `docs/specs/`, `docs/super_events/`, or another appropriate documentation surface.
3. Move final runtime assets into engine-facing folders and verify their `.gfx`, `.gui`, audio, or gameplay references.
4. Delete the complete event-scoped temporary workspace, including empty subfolders, and verify that it is absent. Never delete the separate durable portrait source archive under `docs/assets/portraits/` as part of this cleanup.

An absent event-scoped `docs/assets/` folder is expected after a fully complete goal and is not an asset blocker. If the event is incomplete or blocked, retain the workspace and report the blocker. Never delete skill-local `assets/` reference libraries or an unrelated event workspace.

### Durable portrait source archive

`chaosx_portrait_creator` owns one durable source package for every grounded portrait and archives it without changing runtime identity. Select the mode in the brief or manifest: `source_placeholder` keeps the unchanged source/crop, deterministic `156x210` PNG, DDS, and wiring; `styled_final` is an optional provider branch that starts only after the user explicitly requests it and supplies the result. Never silently repaint, replace, or overwrite provenance.

Store each package together under `docs/assets/portraits/<event_id>_<event_slug>/` (a subject subfolder is allowed), using the exact runtime basename:

```text
<subject>/
  <runtime_portrait_basename>_original.<original_suffix> # untouched original bytes
  <runtime_portrait_basename>_source_crop.png         # lossless crop, before resize/DDS
  <runtime_portrait_basename>_source_crop.json         # exact crop/equality evidence
  <runtime_portrait_basename>_156x210.png              # deterministic processed candidate
  <runtime_portrait_basename>.txt                     # co-located provenance contract
<runtime_portrait_path>/<runtime_portrait_basename>.dds
```

The original source, lossless crop, processed PNG, JSON, and `.txt` contract are mandatory and must never be split across folders. The contract records subject, source URL/attribution/license, hashes, crop coordinates, mode/state, reviewer/date, and separate identity/framing/provenance verdicts. Preserve original-format bytes and a lossless PNG copy when needed. The archive is evidence only: no `.gfx`, character, GUI, event, focus, idea, or decision may reference `docs/assets/portraits/`, and cleanup of temporary event workspaces must not delete it.

## 3. Asset source rules

Choose the source mode based on asset type.

### Scene-first and mood-first selection rule

Do not default event art to maps, cartographic overlays, arrows, staff tables, conference rooms, or generic war-room compositions unless that is the strongest visual for the specific asset.

For Chaos Redux, many event visuals should focus on the actor, force, symbol, ritual, creature, crowd, machine, government, army, leader, or strange condition behind the event. The image should usually make the event feel active and dangerous, not merely show that territory changed.

Prefer visuals that show:

- a country, movement, army, cult, council, machine, plague, or supernatural force as the subject
- people, banners, ruins, storms, fires, shadows, masks, relics, halls, crowds, weapons, monuments, or rituals
- obsession, wrath, zeal, panic, corruption, transformation, prophecy, dread, awe, or other event-specific mood
- fantasy, surreal, mythic, occult, symbolic, or unexplained elements when the event concept supports them
- a clear subject and strong atmosphere over neutral geography

Avoid making the main visual read like:

- a map has changed
- borders have shifted
- officers are discussing an expansion route
- the art is mainly a strategic diagram with decoration
- the scene is a generic command table without a strong event identity

Maps may still appear as secondary props when useful, but they should rarely be the main visual idea for fictional, alternate-history, high-chaos, supernatural, symbolic, or strange event assets.

### Use `$imagegen` for generated symbolic or fictional assets

Use Codex's official `$imagegen` skill by default for:

- idea icons
- focus icons
- decision icons
- decision category icons
- achievement icons
- fictional flag designs
- faction emblems
- UI panels
- progression-state base art
- other symbolic or fictional static assets

When creating generated assets, follow the `$imagegen` skill workflow. Do not define a separate image generation route in this skill.

For transparent icons, ask `$imagegen` for the required transparent output and follow the `$imagegen` skill's transparent image workflow. The final PNG must have real transparency, no fake checkerboard, no white halo, no white outline, and no opaque square background unless the asset type explicitly uses a painted backdrop.

If `$imagegen` is unavailable, report that clearly and stop before using an alternate route.

For generated animated assets, use `$imagegen` through `chaos-redux-frame-animation`. Each animation frame must be generated or edited as its own source frame according to a frame plan. Do not use local filters, transforms, glow pulses, or offsets as the source of final motion.

### Choose source mode for event photo assets

Report images, news images, and super-event images may be either internet-sourced or generated.

Use internet-sourced imagery when the asset must show a real photographed person, specific real battle, real place, real object, real newspaper, real poster, real map, real archive item, or other verifiable historical material.

Use `$imagegen` when the event is fictional, alternate-history, symbolic, supernatural, high-chaos, or when a unique scene is more important than matching an existing archive image. Generated event-photo assets should be prompted as period-authentic documentary material, not modern cinematic concept art.

For generated World War II-era report/news/super-event images:

- prompt for 1936-1945 photographic technology, period composition, period clothing, period vehicles, period architecture, and documentary realism
- avoid modern streets, uniforms, props, weapons, vehicles, signage, UI overlays, cinematic color grading, and readable generated text
- keep the source PNG, processed preview, final DDS, prompt, and manifest entry
- record the source mode as generated and explain why generation fit better than sourcing
- never use text-only generation, a name, a description, or a substitute face to fabricate a real person's likeness, use section 21 for grounded portraits

Follow the repository web research rules from `AGENTS.md` when searching for source images.

For internet-sourced event photo assets that are meant to represent the World War II era, search for period-matching source imagery from roughly 1936 to 1945 unless the event spec gives a narrower date range. Prefer contemporary photographs, war correspondents' photographs, press agency images, propaganda posters, maps, newspapers, official records, government or military archive images, museum scans, library scans, and period illustrations. Do not use modern photographs, reenactment images, film stills, AI-looking reconstructions, postwar uniforms, streets, weapons, vehicles, buildings, colorized tourist photos, reenactments, or modern props when they do not fit the era. If no suitable period source can be found, either generate a period-authentic fictional/documentary image when the asset does not require a real source, or mark the asset as blocked or `needs_user_review`.

Record the image source, source link, author or archive if available, license or public domain status if available, estimated date or date range, why the image fits the World War II era, and any uncertainty in the manifest.

### Portrait source-mode gate

Classify every country-leader, commander, operative, named officeholder, or institutional portrait before routing. A grounded identity (`grounded_source_only`) is any real, partly real, restored, separatist, regional, indigenous, dynastic, or otherwise plausibly historical polity/community/institution; it requires `chaosx_portrait_creator` and attributed real-person or authentic institutional source material. If no defensible source exists, mark `blocked` and never invent a grounded face. A generated one-person portrait is allowed only for a truly fictional high-chaos country or impossible/supernatural entity, and must have an extraordinary internally coherent invented motif rather than a generic face, modern prop, meme, gore, mockery, stereotype, or caricature. Record classification, source mode, evidence, and blocked decisions; missing or contradictory classification fails closed.

### Portrait subject ownership gate

Before sourcing or wiring a real-person token, search installed vanilla and the project for exact/variant names, transliterations, titles, and name order across `common/characters/`, `history/countries/`, `gfx/leaders/`, `interface/`, and `localisation/`. A person already defined, recruited, or portrait-owned by a live roster cannot be cloned. Reuse requires an explicit guarded transfer that invalidates origin ownership before target ownership and prevents simultaneous ownership; otherwise fail closed. Incidental prose, ship names, streets, and equipment are not ownership. Record search terms, roots/ids, matches or no-match evidence, disposition, and any transfer guard in the manifest/handoff; this gate never authorizes a generated grounded person.

### Real-person portraits

Never generate, reconstruct, or substitute a real person's identity. Use an unchanged attributed archival photograph (male subject: archival male photograph), then `extract_portrait_source_crop.py` automatic or explicit crop, durable co-located package, and independent identity/framing/provenance review before DDS. Prefer public-domain/clearly licensed period sources; reject illustrations, statues, reenactors, actors, text descriptions, modern or era-incompatible images, and any unverified crop. The tool preserves source bytes, proves decoded RGBA equality, and writes a lossless crop before deterministic `156x210` resize; `ffmpeg`/ImageMagick output without equivalent equality evidence is invalid. Preserve exact facial geometry, asymmetry, age, expression, hair, pose, and source-visible clothing; reject genericization, beautification, symmetrization, face substitution, invented detail, unsupported insignia, filtered photos, or weak likeness. Compare master, crop, candidate, DDS, and role references at native and ≥4x nearest-neighbour. Record source/attribution/license, hashes, crop coordinates, role references, reviewer/date, separate verdicts, state, runtime path, sprite, and gender/name-pool metadata; female-presenting portraits require matching female metadata/name pools and male-presenting portraits require matching male metadata/name pools, while councils/boards use institutional names. Missing evidence blocks the portrait. `source_placeholder` is complete when selected; set `replacement_pending` only after an explicit outstanding `styled_final` request.


### Fictional portraits

Fictional or impossible portraits use native ImageGen through `chaosx_portrait_creator`, never the grounded replacement branch. One-person leaders require `fictional_high_chaos`, full `156x210` HOI4 framing, a memorable invented motif, matching role/gender/name metadata, and no text, watermark, modern UI, meme, gore, stereotype, or caricature. Institutional briefs use an institutional name and may be people-free; a staged group requires explicit authorization and matching constraints. Grounded institutions still require authentic sourced material, and a named person uses one-person rules.

### User-provided assets

If the user provides an image, treat it as a source asset.

Record that the image was user-provided in the manifest.

Still crop, resize, convert, place, wire, and document it like any other source asset.

## 4. Reference asset examples

This skill owns its visual-reference library under:

`C:\Users\klimp\OneDrive\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod\chaos_redux\.agents\skills\chaos-redux-event-assets\assets`

`assets/vanilla_reference/` is the canonical semantic library, with Vanilla HOI4
as the primary source and explicitly marked Chaos Redux examples where needed.
Do not route reference work through project-root asset folders or another skill-local copy.

Start with:

- library rules and contact sheets: `assets/vanilla_reference/README.md`
- exact source provenance and dimensions: `assets/vanilla_reference/CATALOG.md`

Unless a path below begins with `assets/`, interpret it relative to
`assets/vanilla_reference/`.

Every semantic reference directory contains its own `contact_sheet.png`, there is no shared `contact_sheets/` directory. Contact sheets are labeled with filenames and native dimensions, and are review aids rather than reference examples themselves. Common icon families (focus, ideas, decisions, decision categories, technologies, and achievement states) have at least 15 references, other tracked families have at least 5.

Canonical portrait paths:

- country leaders: `assets/vanilla_reference/portraits/leaders/`
- army and navy commanders: `assets/vanilla_reference/portraits/commanders/`
- operatives: `assets/vanilla_reference/portraits/operatives/`
- advisors and high-command dossier cards: `assets/vanilla_reference/portraits/advisors/`

The explicit user-facing leader reference shelf is also mirrored at
`assets/leader_portraits/`. It is a review-only compatibility path for agents
that need a direct portrait folder, keep it byte-aligned with the canonical
`assets/vanilla_reference/portraits/leaders/` shelf and use its
`REFERENCE_MANIFEST.md` for the current file list. Do not wire either reference
shelf into runtime GFX, and do not infer Event 006 advisor assets from it.
Country leaders, commanders, and operatives are full `156x210` portrait textures.
For portrait work, inspect the canonical role-specific contact sheet.
Advisor and high-command dossier references are native `65x67` cards and use their own canonical contact sheet, do not substitute full leader, commander, or operative portraits for this family.

Canonical flag and event-art paths:

- flat flags: `flags/normal/`, `flags/medium/`, and `flags/small/`
- report-event art: `event_art/report/`
- news-event art: `event_art/news/`
- super-event art: `event_art/super_event/`

Canonical gameplay-icon paths:

- national focus: `icons/national_focus/`
- ideas and national spirits: `icons/ideas/`
- decisions: `icons/decisions/`
- missions: `icons/missions/`
- decision category icons: `icons/decision_categories/`
- decision category pictures: `icons/decision_categories/pictures/`
- achievement state triplets: `icons/achievements/`
- officer corps spirits: `icons/officer_corps_spirits/`
- technologies: `icons/technologies/`
- special projects: `icons/special_projects/`
- balance of power: `icons/balance_of_power/`
- intelligence agencies: `icons/intelligence_agency/`
- intelligence operations: `icons/intelligence_operations/`
- commander traits: `icons/commander_traits/`
- medals: `icons/medals/`
- military raids: `icons/military_raids/`
- state modifiers: `icons/state_modifiers/`
- military industrial organizations: `icons/military_industrial_organizations/`
- factions: `icons/factions/`
- buildings: `icons/buildings/`
- modifiers: `icons/modifiers/`

The canonical decision category picture family is:

`C:\Users\klimp\OneDrive\Documents\Paradox Interactive\Hearts of Iron IV\mod\chaos_redux\.agents\skills\chaos-redux-event-assets\assets\vanilla_reference\icons\decision_categories\pictures`

This family contains the larger visual pictures used to establish a decision category's theme or territorial context. It is separate from the small category icon family at `icons/decision_categories/`.

The current reference examples use a native `114x101` canvas. Treat that size as the reference-family canvas, not as a universal runtime assumption. Inspect the active vanilla or Chaos Redux sprite and GUI consumer before choosing the final runtime size.

The picture folder must contain its own `contact_sheet.png`. If the contact sheet is missing, create it before new category-picture work. Label every reference with its filename and native dimensions, record each source as Vanilla, Chaos Redux, or user-provided reference material in `CATALOG.md`, and update the reference library README when the family or workflow changes. The reference images and contact sheet are review-only assets. Never wire, recolour, trace, or ship them as runtime art.

After placing a technology or doctrine icon, use `hoi4.tech_inspect` in `explain` or `lint` mode to verify the sprite and texture references, then use the `assets` or affected folder view in `hoi4.tech_render` for deterministic review. Missing or ambiguous assets remain implementation findings, this skill still owns source art, processing, DDS conversion, placement, manifests, and sprite handoff.

Canonical unit-visual paths:

- equipment and technology art: `units/equipment/technology_art/`
- large land-unit counters: `units/land/counters_large/`
- land map counters: `units/land/map_counters/`
- division-template emblems: `units/land/division_template_emblems/`
- air map counters: `units/air/map_counters/`
- naval map counters: `units/naval/map_counters/`
- land model materials: `units/models_3d/land_materials/`
- air model materials: `units/models_3d/air_materials/`
- naval model materials: `units/models_3d/naval_materials/`

The tree is semantic, not a bank of interchangeable pictures. Use the folder for the exact owning UI or model surface, then follow the cataloged source, native canvas, frame count, transparency, and owning definition.

The canonical `assets/vanilla_reference/` tree remains the source of truth for exact engine surfaces and semantic ownership.

The reusable achievement not-eligible compositing overlay lives at
`icons/achievements/overlay.png`. It is a workflow
input rather than a reference example, so it is excluded from the achievement
contact sheet and coverage count.

Do not add new reference images outside the skill-local `assets/` root. Add
semantic references under `assets/vanilla_reference/` with exact provenance,
dimensions, and contact-sheet coverage recorded in its catalog. The explicit
`assets/leader_portraits/` compatibility shelf is the one allowed mirrored
exception: it must contain only byte-aligned copies of the curated leader
references plus its own manifest/contact sheet, and it is never a new source of
truth or a runtime asset folder.

Before generating, sourcing, processing, or wiring an asset, read the library
rules, inspect the matching category and contact sheet, and follow the vanilla
source path in the catalog to its owning `.gfx`, `.gui`, `.asset`, or `.mesh`
definition when engine behavior matters. Reference PNGs are never final assets:
do not wire, recolor, trace, or ship them. If no category matches, inspect the
closest canonical category plus a direct vanilla or established Chaos Redux
precedent before choosing a style.

## 5. Generated artwork rules

Do not create core artwork from simple shapes, placeholders, contact sheets, layout-only mockups, empty UI boxes, or generated charts. Final art must be real generated, sourced, or user-provided artwork, not circles, rectangles, lines, gradients, geometric diagrams, or other primitive-shape stand-ins.

For super-event images, this rule is strict: final art must be a real scene, archival image, painted illustration, or generated documentary-style image. Do not use symbolic diagrams, flat icons, abstract geometry, title cards, or UI-like compositions as the final super-event image unless the user explicitly requests that exact visual approach and the exception is documented.

Use `$imagegen` for generated artwork and follow the `$imagegen` skill workflow for the source image.

Generated artwork must be real source art that can be processed into the final game asset. Final assets must be clean: must not have sticking artifacts, an icon is centered in the image, etc. Do not use contact sheets, review boards, or layout drafts as final source art.

## 5.1 Icon creation rules

Small gameplay icons must be readable at their final in-game size.

- Use transparent backgrounds for asset types that are transparent in vanilla, especially idea and decision icons and small symbolic interface icons.
- Keep unused pixels fully transparent. Do not leave a square opaque fill behind icons unless the asset type explicitly uses a painted frame or backdrop.
- Give the icon silhouette a dark or black outline and a subtle drop shadow when the icon is displayed over variable UI backgrounds. Do not leave some chroma green outline on the icon.
- Avoid tiny interior detail that disappears at 45x45 or 64x64. Favor one clear subject, strong value contrast, and a centered silhouette.
- Avoid fake checkerboard pixels, white halos, white outlines, oversized medallion fills, and square opaque backdrops.

For every generated icon, follow the `$imagegen` skill's transparent image workflow. Preserve the original generated image, create a processed PNG preview, convert to DDS, and validate the final appearance over a checker background before treating the icon as complete.

The final icon should have transparent unused canvas, no fake checker or matte pixels, no transparent holes inside the painted subject, a slight black outline, a subtle drop shadow, and a centered subject that remains readable at final size.

Generated icon packages must keep visible `$imagegen` source evidence: save the source atlas or source PNGs, record the prompt and source mode in the manifest, process to real transparent backgrounds, and include a contact sheet that shows final alignment, dimensions, transparency, and absence of white matte or opaque square backgrounds. Do not mark a generated icon complete if the final art is a primitive local drawing, a resized unrelated icon, or a locally assembled shape substitute instead of imagegen or sourced artwork.

## 5.2 Icon type separation rules

Focus, idea, national-spirit, officer-corps, decision, mission, decision-category, achievement, technology, special-project, balance-of-power, intelligence-agency, intelligence-operation, commander-trait, medal, military-raid, state-modifier, MIO, faction, building, and modifier icons are separate asset types.

Never treat focus, idea, and decision icons as interchangeable.

Do not create focus icons first and then satisfy idea icons or decision icons by resizing, cropping, shrinking, recoloring, padding, or lightly editing the focus icon. This is not a valid asset workflow.

Each icon type must have its own asset-type-specific brief, reference inspection, source artwork, prompt or source choice, crop, target size, filename prefix, manifest entry, and final DDS output.

Shared visual themes are allowed only when every icon is still designed for its own in-game use:

- focus icons should read as full HOI4 focus art at 94x86 with focus-tree style detail and composition
- idea and national spirit icons should read as compact 64x64 symbolic spirit art without borrowing the full focus icon frame
- decision icons should read clearly at 32x32 with simpler shapes, stronger silhouettes, and less interior detail
- decision category icons should be designed for the category button or scripted GUI surface, not derived from a focus icon
- officer corps spirit icons should follow the vanilla officer corps spirit look and 45x45 transparent style
- achievement icons should follow achievement presentation rules and variant rules
- intelligence-agency and intelligence-operation icons must follow their own agency or operation UI precedent rather than a generic decision treatment
- commander traits, medals, military raids, state modifiers, MIOs, factions, buildings, and modifier icons must follow the matching canonical folder and owning vanilla definition, do not force these families onto a blanket 32x32 or 64x64 canvas
- frame strips, indexed building sprites, and multi-state modifier art must retain their frame order and frame count rather than being treated as a single standalone icon

If a mechanic needs matching focus, idea, and decision visuals, build them as a coordinated icon family. A coordinated family can share subject matter, symbols, colors, and lore cues, but each member still needs separate source art or a separate generated output designed for its target size and UI role.

The manifest must record the exact asset type for every icon and should note when icons are part of a coordinated family. Do not mark an icon complete if it only exists as a resized version of another icon type.

## 6. Required asset workflow

For every asset package:

1. Read the event spec, asset prompt, or implementation task.
2. Identify every required visual asset.
3. Group assets by usage type.
4. Split every icon family named in section 5.2 into its own asset-type work item. Never satisfy one UI surface by resizing, relabeling, or lightly editing art created for another surface.
5. Assign each asset a stable filename.
6. Assign each asset a sprite name if it needs one.
7. Identify the target size.
8. Identify the intended in-game use.
9. Inspect the matching reference folder from section 4 before generating, sourcing, processing, or wiring the asset.
10. Decide the source mode for each asset:
   - `$imagegen` for generated non-portrait event art and other asset families that explicitly allow it
   - unchanged sourced image plus durable provenance for grounded character portraits, follow section 21
   - portrait-worker-owned native ImageGen for an authorized fictional or impossible portrait
   - internet source image
   - user-provided source image
   For one-person country-leader or officeholder portraits, record the grounded or `fictional_high_chaos` identity classification before selecting a mode.
   A grounded identity must use a sourced real person, an unavailable defensible source is `blocked`, never a generated substitute.
   Before sourcing or wiring a real-person leader, commander, operative, or named officeholder, apply the portrait subject ownership gate above and record its evidence.
   Missing or contradictory source-mode or ownership evidence fails closed.
11. For every grounded real-person leader, commander, operative, or named-officeholder portrait, create the exact crop evidence, preserve the durable source/prompt pair, and follow section 21.
12. Complete section 21 review, a pending or failed identity gate is `needs_user_review` or `blocked`, never wired.
13. If the asset is animated, follow `chaos-redux-frame-animation` before ordinary static processing. Write the animation brief and frame plan, create or approve the static fallback, generate or source every frame, then normalize the frame sequence.
14. For `$imagegen` assets, write a specific image generation prompt and create the base artwork by following the official `$imagegen` skill.
15. For internet-sourced assets, find a suitable source image and record its source link, author or archive if available, and license or public domain status if available.
16. For user-provided assets, record that the image was provided by the user.
17. Save the original generated, sourced, or provided image as a source PNG.
18. For every sourced portrait, save the durable source under `docs/assets/portraits/<event_id>_<event_slug>/` using the exact runtime DDS basename.
19. Crop and resize non-portrait assets to the target size. For portraits, follow section 21 after creating the exact lossless source crop and JSON equality evidence from section 3. Do not treat an `ffmpeg` or ImageMagick crop as immutable unless its decoded pixels are independently proven equal to the same decoded master rectangle.
20. Save a processed PNG preview.
21. Convert a real-person portrait to DDS only after an independent audit PASS, convert other processed assets to DDS 32 bit unsigned BGRB 8.8.8.8.
22. Move the DDS into the correct mod folder.
23. Create or update the asset manifest.
24. Create or update `gfx_handoff.md` for any asset that needs a sprite definition.
25. Update event docs or asset docs when the parent prompt grants that documentation scope.
26. Report all created files, durable portrait sources, proposed sprite names, final paths, independent audit status, blocked assets, and any handoff uncertainty.

Do not mark assets complete until the DDS files exist, the manifest is written, every real-person portrait has an independent audit PASS, and the main agent has enough handoff information to wire every sprite without guessing.

## Asset depth from improvement addenda

When an improvement addendum asks for richer presentation, the asset handoff should name the visual states instead of asking for generic polish. A good asset request says what the player sees before activation, while active, when locked, when dangerous, when complete, and when the route has failed.

For scripted GUI, plan asset families. A panel usually needs a background, header, button states, value icons, warning indicators, progress frames, locked overlays, selected overlays, hover states, and any animated glow, particle, float, or pulse layers. The main agent owns `.gui` and `.gfx` wiring, but the asset package must provide clear sprite names, sizes, frame counts, static fallbacks, and contact sheets.

## 7. Asset package structure

When creating a new event asset package, use a stable temporary working folder.

Recommended working structure:

```text
docs/assets/<event_id>_<event_slug>/
  manifest.md
  prompts/
  source_png/
  processed_png/
  contact_sheets/
  notes/
```

Final DDS files must be moved into the correct gameplay asset folders.

Do not keep final assets under `docs/assets/`.

Keep this workspace through active implementation, review, and validation only. Before the event goal is fully complete, preserve any durable provenance or coverage facts in permanent docs, then delete the entire event-scoped workspace. Do not require the deleted workspace to exist for a completion claim.

Sourced portraits also require the separate durable archive from section 2.3 under `docs/assets/portraits/<event_id>_<event_slug>/`. This archive is not part of the temporary event workspace and survives its cleanup.

## 8. Manifest requirements

Every active event asset workspace must include a markdown manifest.

Recommended path while work is active:

```text
docs/assets/<event_id>_<event_slug>/manifest.md
```

The manifest must list every asset. Before deleting the temporary workspace, copy any durable provenance, licensing, attribution, coverage, review, and exception facts needed by the event documentation or audit handoff into a permanent documentation surface.

Each asset entry should include:

- asset name
- related event id
- related event slug
- asset type
- intended in-game use
- source mode: `$imagegen`, portrait-production output, internet source image, or user-provided source image
- image generation prompt if generated with `$imagegen`
- source link if internet-sourced
- source author, archive, or collection if available
- source date or estimated date range if internet-sourced
- license or public domain status if available
- era-fit note for World War II-era assets
- source PNG path
- processed PNG path
- final DDS path
- target size
- sprite name
- `.gfx` file
- localisation key if relevant
- related focus, idea, event, decision, UI element, or super-event if relevant
- notes
- asset status
- frame count, frame timing, loop behavior, and anchor point for animated assets
- static fallback path and animated sheet or frame-sequence path for animated assets
- source mode and source note for every animation frame when animated
- for real-person portraits, source path/hash/attribution, crop evidence, the wired source-placeholder when selected, the provider-backed styled final when explicitly requested and available, role references, and review evidence
- for real-person portraits, independent reviewer identity and date, proof that the reviewer is not the producer, separate likeness/style/provenance verdicts, and the portrait gate state
- portrait subject-ownership search terms, roots/files and ids checked, matched owner or consumer (or explicit no-match evidence), disposition, and any guarded transfer/availability contract
- durable portrait source path, exact wired runtime DDS basename/path, and the selected portrait mode/state
- portrait state: `source_placeholder` (accepted unchanged source/crop runtime), `replacement_pending` (only after an explicit styled-final request remains outstanding), `styled_final` (validated provider-backed output), `not_needed`, or `blocked`

Use `not_needed`, `planned`, `sourced`, `generated`, `processed`, `converted`, `handed_off`, `wired`, `complete`, `needs_user_review`, or `blocked` as asset statuses.

## 8.1 Requirement-to-runtime coverage audit

Before any asset completion claim, create or refresh a row-level coverage crosswalk from every accepted asset requirement in the current specs, manifest plans, and animation plans. Do not start from the assets that happen to be live. Each accepted row must identify:

- its requirement id and accepted design source
- its intended in-game purpose
- the exact source package and manifest entry
- the exact runtime registration: final asset path plus the `.gfx` sprite or texture, engine lookup id, or other owning definition as applicable
- the live consumer file and id
- the state or visibility binding when the asset is conditional or state-driven
- the current audit record path, evidence, and row status

For every animation family, also record the purpose and the direction or state semantics that distinguish the family, together with its frame, timing, and loop evidence. Frame totals, live animation-family totals, and registered sprite totals are not coverage proof.

For every real-person portrait row, link the unchanged source, explicit crop, wired placeholder, user-supplied final when available, role references, comparison evidence, reviewer, and likeness/framing/provenance verdict. Style quality cannot compensate for identity failure.

Audit exact rows, not counts. An extra asset or animation cannot satisfy an absent accepted row unless an explicit accepted design amendment identifies that row and names the replacement, link that amendment in the crosswalk. Any missing source package, runtime registration, live consumer, required state or visibility binding, or current audit record leaves the row incomplete.

After a late user correction or accepted spec, manifest-plan, or animation-plan change, rebuild the crosswalk against the current repository and attach a fresh coverage diff listing added, removed or replaced, changed, and still-uncovered rows. Do not reuse the prior audit or its totals for the completion claim.

## 9. Standard HOI4 asset sizes

Use these sizes unless the event spec or an existing repo pattern gives a better project-specific requirement.

- report event images: 210x176
- news event images: 397x153, black and white
- country-leader portraits: 156x210
- commander portraits: 156x210 full portrait textures, never a fabricated 50x67 source texture
- operative portraits: 156x210 full portrait textures, still follow the cataloged owning sprite
- flags small: 10x7
- flags medium: 41x26
- flags normal: 82x52
- tech icons small: 64x64
- tech icons medium: 132x52
- achievements: 64x64
- super-event images: 457x328
- decision icons: 32x32
- idea and national spirit icons: 64x64
- focus icons: 94x86

Use other sizes when the event's UI or asset type requires it.

For every icon, counter, emblem, strip, or model material not listed above, take the canvas and frame behavior from the matching canonical catalog entry and owning vanilla definition. Do not infer a universal size from the folder name or from a visually similar asset family.

When unsure, inspect the existing Chaos Redux pattern and vanilla HOI4 assets before choosing.

## 9.1 Unit visual references

Treat every unit visual as a domain-and-surface-specific pipeline. Inspect the matching catalog entries, contact sheet, and owning vanilla definition before deciding what the task needs.

- `units/equipment/technology_art/` contains flat 2D equipment illustrations used by equipment and technology sprites. Native canvases vary, follow the owning `interface/*.gfx` sprite.
- `units/land/counters_large/` contains large frame-aware land-unit strips. Preserve the cataloged `noOfFrames`, frame order, per-frame footprint, and transparent bounds.
- `units/land/map_counters/` contains land map-counter art. It is not a large division-designer strip.
- `units/land/division_template_emblems/` contains division-template identity emblems. It is not equipment art or map-counter art.
- `units/air/map_counters/` and `units/naval/map_counters/` contain domain-specific map-counter art. Do not substitute land counters or resized equipment art.
- `units/models_3d/land_materials/`, `units/models_3d/air_materials/`, and `units/models_3d/naval_materials/` contain UV model materials paired with cataloged `.mesh`, `.asset`, and entity definitions. They are not 2D icons, finished renders, or concept sheets.

Classify the requested deliverable before creating art: equipment/technology illustration, large land counter, land/air/naval map counter, division-template emblem, or land/air/naval 3D model package. Give each class its own brief, source art, native canvas or UV layout, frame metadata, final path, and handoff. A 3D task must keep model geometry, materials, entity wiring, and any separately produced concept reference distinct. Do not derive one unit pipeline by resizing, relabeling, or recoloring another.

### 2D icon and counter generation contract

Apply this contract to every small template, facility, or unit icon, including large land counters and division-template emblems.

Before generation, inspect the actual installed-vanilla consumer definition and DDS, plus the exact matching reference family and contact sheet under `assets/vanilla_reference/`. Record the owning `.gfx`, `.gui`, unit, building, or template definition, runtime token or sprite, native canvas, frame count and order, frame or state semantics, alpha and background treatment, border, sampled palette, silhouette footprint, shading, and contrast. If the consumer, DDS, or matching reference family cannot be inspected, mark the asset `blocked` instead of guessing.

Use the built-in ImageGen tool for each distinct final asset and retain its exact prompt and native source PNG in the evidence package. Generate the icon or glyph as real raster source art, pixel art, pixel-grid or nearest-neighbor final scaling, primitive local drawings, SVG-only reconstruction, resized cross-type substitutes, opaque backgrounds, and generic white duplicates are prohibited. Nearest-neighbor is permitted only for enlarged inspection previews.

For transparent sources, use the approved built-in ImageGen chroma-key-to-alpha workflow and the installed `remove_chroma_key.py` helper described by the ImageGen skill, then validate transparent corners, no key-coloured fringe, and no fake checkerboard or matte. Downsample smoothly with bicubic or Lanczos to the inspected native runtime canvas, preserve the intended transparent bounds, and record the visible alpha bounding box, centered footprint, frame boundaries, and per-frame footprint against the vanilla reference. Do not promote a candidate whose silhouette is clipped, off-center, too small, or too detailed at native size.

For a large land division counter, the final file is one transparent `152x42` strip containing two adjacent `76x42` frames with no gap. The left frame is a compact muted vanilla-green silhouette for the normal large-counter state. The right frame is a separate sparse pale or white generic schematic glyph for the alternate or template state and is never a detailed white repaint or duplicate of the left frame. Differentiate each unit by role and silhouette while staying within the same restrained vanilla vocabulary.

For division-template emblems, produce separate transparent large `76x42` and small `30x12` canvases with a centered compact emblem footprint. Keep both sizes simple, smooth, muted green or olive, and within the restrained vanilla vocabulary. A template emblem is a separate asset family from a large counter strip and is not a counter strip.

Keep source, processed, and runtime files in separate surfaces. Until the parent has reviewed the package and the goal is complete, retain the native ImageGen source PNG, processed alpha PNG, saved prompt, native-size contact sheet, manifest, handoff, and validation files in the evidence directory. Select the final source explicitly before synchronization and never silently copy an older candidate or processed path back onto a runtime surface.

Every icon, counter, or emblem package requires a native-size contact sheet comparing the source, processed transparency, an enlarged smooth preview, and the decoded DDS round-trip, with filenames, dimensions, frame labels, and visible-bounds notes. Convert the processed PNG with `.agents/skills/chaos-redux-event-assets/tools/convert_to_dds.py`, apply section 24's exact DDS-header, byte-length, dimension, and alpha validation, decode the DDS back at native size, and retain the round-trip comparison and validation evidence. The parent must visually review the contact sheet before runtime promotion. The worker reports `needs_user_review` or `blocked` until that review and never claims in-game completion.

### 3D model package handoff

Route 3D model production to `chaos-redux-3d-model-pipeline` and `chaosx_3d_model_pipeline`. The 3D worker owns the mandatory custom-unit counter requirement and bounded `chaosx_icon_artist` handoff, while this 2D asset pipeline owns final counter art. Equipment art, division emblems, and frame-sheet animation remain separate production surfaces.

Before any provider or paid work, the 3D route must verify a nonblank `MESHY_API_KEY`, the selected pinned Meshy MCP route, the narrow Blender HOI4 adapter, the installed Blender version, and the checksum-locked `io_pdx_mesh` setup.

When a ready reference is absent, the route creates exactly one clean `meshy_input.png` for the asset. Never create or send side-profile sheets, turnaround boards, collages, or multi-view boards to Meshy. Contact sheets and Blender renders are QA evidence only.

Every 3D asset brief must identify the asset profile, deterministic job root, provider task lineage, reference checksum, named vanilla mesh and entity precedent, source geometry height, entity scale, effective runtime height, axes, origin, contact plane, required actions, root-motion policy, PDX material channels, texture dimensions, `.mesh` and `.anim` outputs, reimport proof, runtime hashes, and live consumer.

For humanoid units, calibrate against the installed vanilla infantry source mesh and entity rather than an assumed real-world height or arbitrary entity scale. Apply the entity scale exactly once and record the source-height-to-runtime-height crosswalk.

Provider source files are immutable evidence. Working geometry must be repaired so it has no holes, loose or non-manifold geometry, degenerate triangles, missing components, or zero-weight deforming vertices. Use the verified PDX shader and packed specular map convention, never route raw grayscale roughness into the PDX specular channel because that creates chrome-black surfaces.

For animated units, provider actions are candidates that must be cleaned, retargeted or authored, baked, checked for root policy, grounded contacts, deformation, FPS, frame range, and loop behavior, then exported and reimported as real `.anim` files. A static image or still mesh is not an acceptable substitute for a requested skeletal action.

The asset worker owns source files, checkpoints, processed textures, previews, exports, manifests, reports, reimport evidence, and a runtime handoff. The main implementation agent owns `.asset`, entity, `.gfx`, unit/building/gameplay wiring, final runtime synchronization, and in-game screenshots.

## 10. Naming rules

Use lowercase snake_case.

Keep names stable once they are wired into `.gfx`.

Recommended filename prefixes:

- idea icons: `idea_`
- focus icons: `goal_`
- decision icons: `decision_`
- decision category icons: `decision_category_`
- report event images: `report_event_`
- news event images: `news_event_`
- super-event images: `super_event_`
- achievement icons: `achievement_`
- country-leader portraits: `leader_`
- commander portraits: `commander_`
- operative portraits: `operative_`

For event-specific assets, include the event id or slug where useful. For example, all idea assets related to an event should go into one folder of that event.

## 11. Image generation prompt rules

Every `$imagegen` prompt should be specific enough to produce usable game art.

A good prompt should include:

- asset type
- target in-game use
- subject
- visual style
- readability requirements
- what must be avoided
- whether the result must be readable at small size

Do not ask for vague "cool icon" style outputs.

Do not rely on text inside generated images. Generated text is unreliable.

Prefer strong symbols, clear silhouettes, and readable composition.

For transparent icon prompts, explicitly request a transparent canvas, no fake checkerboard, no white rim, no white/colored outline, no glow, no sticker border, no opaque square background, and a clean silhouette suitable for HOI4 UI.

## 12. Internet source image rules

When using internet source images:

1. Search for images that fit the event tone, target use, and intended era.
2. For World War II-era event assets, search for source images from roughly 1936 to 1945 unless the event spec gives a narrower date range.
3. Prefer contemporary or near-contemporary public domain, archival, official, museum, library, newspaper, map, press photograph, propaganda poster, government record, military record, period illustration, or clearly licensed sources.
4. Reject modern photographs, reenactments, film stills, postwar streets, uniforms, props, weapons, vehicles, buildings, AI-looking reconstructions, and later stylized images when they do not fit the era.
5. Record source links, source date or estimated date range, and license or public domain status when available.
6. If licensing, date, or era fit is unclear, mark it as uncertain in the manifest.
7. Process the image into the correct HOI4 size and style.
8. Preserve the source image path and processed preview path.

For public-facing or uncertain assets, keep the manifest honest about the source status, date uncertainty, and World War II-era fit uncertainty.

## 13. Report event images

Report event images may use internet-sourced imagery or generated period-documentary imagery. Prefer generated report images when the event needs a unique fictional or alternate-history scene, staged document, invented location, or more specific visual than archive search can reliably provide. Use real sources when the image must depict a real person, real historical scene, or real archival document.

Report event images should look like documentary-style photographs, field documentation, or period documentary material.

For World War II-era subjects, prefer contemporary photographs, war correspondents' photographs, press agency images, propaganda posters, newspapers, maps, official records, military archive images, museum or library scans, or period illustrations. Do not use modern reenactment photos or modern documentary photos that visually belong to a later era.

Use:

- realistic or period-authentic source imagery
- black-and-white treatment with sepia applied
- World War II-era visual fit when the event belongs to that era
- period-appropriate framing where possible
- strong subject clarity
- natural composition
- no modern UI overlays
- no modern clothing, streets, weapons, vehicles, buildings, or props unless they are intentionally part of the event
- no generated text

Target size:

```text
210x176
```

Report event images must be black and white with sepia applied. Do not leave report event images in full colour unless the user explicitly requests a colour exception, and record that exception in the manifest.

### Report-event card treatment

Report-event images use a finished `210x176` RGBA canvas. The source photograph is processed as a slightly tilted documentary card with transparent edge space and a soft drop shadow. The transparent corners are part of the style.

Do not ask `$imagegen` to create the tilted card. Generate or source the documentary photograph first, then apply the card treatment locally. This keeps the tilt, shadow, and margins consistent.

```powershell
python -B .agents/skills/chaos-redux-event-assets/tools/process_report_event_image.py source.png processed_report_event.png
python -B .agents/skills/chaos-redux-event-assets/tools/process_report_event_image.py source_folder processed_folder
```

The script performs cover crop, black-and-white conversion, sepia application, grain, paper border, deterministic tilt, transparent canvas margin, and soft shadow. It writes RGBA PNG output. Convert the processed PNG to DDS through the normal repo workflow.

Validation:

- processed PNG is exactly `210x176`
- final DDS is exactly `210x176`
- corner pixels are transparent
- no hard photo pixels are clipped
- tilt is visible but subtle
- shadow is soft and not a thick border
- edge space is transparent, not black padding
- source remains readable after crop, tilt, shadow, and DDS conversion

Generated report images must still receive this local report-card treatment.

## 14. News event images

News event images may use internet-sourced imagery or generated period-news imagery. Prefer generated news images when the event needs a unique fictional or alternate-history scene, invented crisis, or scene that is unlikely to exist in archives. Use real sources when the image must depict a real person, real historical scene, or real archival item.

News images should look like black-and-white documentary photographs or period news illustrations.

For World War II-era subjects, prefer contemporary newspapers, news photographs, war correspondents' photographs, press agency images, propaganda posters, maps, official visual records, military archive images, museum or library scans, or period illustrations. Do not use modern reenactment photos, modern news photos, film stills, or later images that do not fit the era.

Use:

- old news photograph or period press illustration style
- World War II-era visual fit when the event belongs to that era
- clear central subject
- strong contrast
- period-appropriate composition
- no modern UI overlays
- no modern clothing, streets, weapons, vehicles, buildings, or props unless they are intentionally part of the event
- no generated text

Target size:

```text
397x153
```

News images must be black and white.

Generated news images must be converted to black and white during processing, with period press contrast/grain and no modern color remnants. Record the source link and license or public domain status for internet-sourced images, or the generation prompt and source-mode rationale for generated images.

## 15. Super-event images

Super-event images may use internet-sourced imagery or generated art. Prefer generated super-event images for fictional, alternate-history, symbolic, supernatural, high-chaos, or emotionally specific moments where a unique composed image better fits the super-event role. Use internet sources when the image must depict a real historical person, real photographed event, or real archival artifact.

Super-event images should have:

- strong central composition
- clear dramatic theme
- readable subject
- enough contrast for HOI4 UI
- World War II-era visual fit when the event belongs to that era
- no generated text
- no modern clothing, streets, weapons, vehicles, buildings, props, film stills, or reenactment imagery when they do not fit the era
- no cluttered small details that disappear at final size

Target size:

```text
457x328
```

If a super-event needs an audio cue, use `chaos-redux-super-events` and research a suitable public domain or clearly licensed recording. Register the final cue as sound from the event-scoped `sound/<event_id>_<event_slug>/` folder. Never create event or super-event audio from generated test tones, primitive waveforms, beeps, noise beds, or local oscillator output, that includes sine, square, triangle, and sawtooth waveforms.

For each track, document:

- title
- composer
- performer or recording source if relevant
- public domain status or license status
- source link
- why it fits
- suggested in-game use
- editing notes

Do not claim public domain status without checking.

If the license is unclear, mark it as uncertain or unsuitable.

## 16. Idea and national spirit icons

Idea and national spirit icons should look like compact HOI4-style icon art.

They should have:

- strong central symbol
- clear silhouette
- aged texture
- strong contrast
- readable meaning at 64x64
- no generated text

Target size:

```text
64x64
```

Use `idea_` filename prefix.

These icons usually do not need the full focus icon frame.

Do not derive idea or national spirit icons from focus icons. They must be designed as 64x64 spirit-style icons from their own prompt or source art, even when they share a theme with a focus.

Use `$imagegen` for the base artwork unless the user provides or requests a specific source image.

Follow the `$imagegen` skill's transparent image workflow when the icon should have a transparent background.

Inspect `icons/ideas/` and the matching row in `CATALOG.md` before generating or processing idea icons.

## 17. Focus icons

Focus icons should look like normal HOI4 focus icons.

They should have:

- strong central symbol
- clear silhouette
- aged texture
- painterly detail
- readable contrast
- meaningful relation to the focus
- no generated text

Target size:

```text
94x86
```

Use `goal_` filename prefix.

Do not make focus icons look like generic generated thumbnails.

Do not create a focus icon as the master artwork for idea icons, decision icons, or other smaller icon types. A focus icon can share a theme with those icons, but it must remain a separate focus-specific asset.

Every focus icon should support the focus tree's story, ideology, or gameplay purpose.

Use `$imagegen` for the base artwork unless the user provides or requests a specific source image.

Follow the `$imagegen` skill's transparent image workflow when the icon should have a transparent background.

Inspect `icons/national_focus/` and the matching row in `CATALOG.md` before generating or processing focus icons. Do not force every focus source onto an older nominal canvas when the owning sprite and current vanilla precedent use a different native canvas.

## 18. Decision icons

Decision icons must remain readable at very small size.

Use:

- simple symbolic composition
- strong contrast
- clear central shape
- limited small detail
- no generated text

Target size:

```text
32x32
```

Use `decision_` filename prefix.

Do not derive decision icons from focus icons or idea icons. They must be composed for 32x32 readability from their own prompt or source art.

Decision category icons may use:

```text
decision_category_
```

Use `$imagegen` for the base artwork unless the user provides or requests a specific source image.

Follow the `$imagegen` skill's transparent image workflow when the icon should have a transparent background.

Inspect `icons/decisions/`, `icons/missions/`, or `icons/decision_categories/` as appropriate before generating or processing decision-system icons. Missions use the decision icon pipeline but still need mission-specific semantic readability.

## 18.1 Decision category pictures

A decision category picture is a larger visual surface used inside or beside a decision category. It is not a `32x32` decision icon, a small category icon, a custom-window background, or a substitute for an interactive scripted GUI.

Use a category picture when the category needs strong identity, historical context, propaganda, territorial orientation, or a readable theme while the normal decision list already carries the gameplay actions.

Suitable subjects include:

- propaganda posters and public campaigns
- civil-war mobilization, insurgency, and preparedness
- elections, ideology, monarchy, party control, and trade-union politics
- faction management, treaties, naval agreements, and foreign intervention
- formable territory maps
- national symbols, institutions, aerial views, documentary scenes, and period objects

Choose the source route by content:

- use `chaosx_asset_source_researcher` for real propaganda posters, real photographs, archival maps, real documents, and other verifiable historical material
- use `chaosx_generated_event_art` for fictional or alternate-history posters, symbolic category pictures, generated documentary scenes, and non-icon illustrated panels
- use deterministic map data and exact state geometry for formable territory pictures and state-puzzle pieces. Do not ask ImageGen to invent state borders

Generated category pictures must not contain fake interface controls, fake meters, fake buttons, unreadable generated text, modern UI, or decoration that implies a click action. Sourced posters may retain real source text when it is legible and appropriate, but provenance and cropping must remain documented.

A static picture is the normal choice. Use an animated picture only when motion communicates a changing state or supports an active propaganda, mobilization, crisis, or transformation theme. Animated pictures follow `chaos-redux-frame-animation` and require real source frames, a static fallback, a sheet, preview, manifest, and sprite handoff.

Before production, inspect:

`assets/vanilla_reference/icons/decision_categories/pictures/contact_sheet.png`

Also inspect the exact active consumer to confirm canvas, crop, alpha, frame behavior, and runtime path. The reference family uses `114x101`, but the consumer decides the final target.

The asset manifest and handoff must state whether the output is:

- small category icon
- static category picture
- animated category picture
- compact scripted GUI display
- full mechanic-window asset

Do not let one asset satisfy several of these surfaces by resizing or relabeling it.

## Additional gameplay icon families

Route additional icon work by the exact UI surface:

- intelligence identity and action: `icons/intelligence_agency/` and `icons/intelligence_operations/`
- commander progression and honours: `icons/commander_traits/` and `icons/medals/`
- operations and world state: `icons/military_raids/` and `icons/state_modifiers/`
- organizations and map/economy identity: `icons/military_industrial_organizations/`, `icons/factions/`, and `icons/buildings/`
- generic or text-linked modifier presentation: `icons/modifiers/`

Read the matching canonical catalog entries and inspect the owning `.gfx`, `.gui`, or database definition before choosing canvas, frame layout, transparency, or filename. These families are not reskinned decision or idea icons. When a source is a strip or contains several UI states, preserve its frame semantics and document them in the manifest and handoff.

## 19. Achievement icons

Achievement icons should be compact and readable at 64x64.

Generate the completed achievement icon first with `$imagegen`.

Then create:

- grey variant (simply black and white)
- not-eligible variant by copying the grey variant and compositing `icons/achievements/overlay.png` on top

The variants may be created after the completed icon exists.

Do not create not-eligible achievement icons by red-tinting, filtering, darkening, recoloring, or manually redrawing the grey icon. If the overlay file is missing or cannot be applied cleanly, stop and report the asset as blocked instead of substituting another treatment.

Target size:

```text
64x64
```

Use an `achievement_` prefix for source or intermediate art when it helps distinguish the asset type.

For Chaos Redux final files, achievements are a root-only exception. Put completed, grey, and not-eligible DDS files directly under `gfx/achievements/`, and name them after the exact achievement id registered in `common/achievements/`:

```text
gfx/achievements/<achievement_id>.dds
gfx/achievements/<achievement_id>_grey.dds
gfx/achievements/<achievement_id>_not_eligible.dds
```

When renaming or adding achievement ids, update `common/achievements/`, `localisation/english/chaosx_achievements_l_english.yml`, `interface/chaosx_achievements.gfx`, the three DDS variants in `gfx/achievements/`, and any docs or manifests that list the final DDS paths. If the achievement registry owns a single `unique_id`, keep it as one root-level registry file and group event-owned achievements by event section inside the file instead of splitting it into per-event achievement files.

Inspect `icons/achievements/` before generating or processing achievement icons. The reference set includes a completed, grey, and not-eligible triplet, keep all three states aligned to the exact achievement id.

## 20. Flags

Flags should use clean symbolic designs that look like intentional flag designs, not simple-shape placeholders, palette swaps, ugly filters, or flipped/recolored variants. Treat flags as flat identity assets, not artwork or illustrated scenes.

Inspect the complete flat flag ladders in `flags/normal/`, `flags/medium/`, and `flags/small/` before creating or processing flags. Compare all three sizes together in `flags/contact_sheet.png`.

They must remain readable at HOI4 sizes.

Required flag sizes:

- small: 10x7
- medium: 41x26
- normal: 82x52

HOI4 flag TGAs must use the same origin/header convention as vanilla flags. Validate with `file`, completed flag TGAs should read as Targa image data at the correct size and must not end with `- top`. If a flag displays upside down in-game while the artwork looks correct in an image viewer, fix the TGA encoding/origin on the flag files themselves. Do not add custom UI sprites, scripted-localisation routing, DDS display copies, or other workarounds for flag orientation.

Use enough heraldic detail to prove that the design is authored rather than a basic-shape placeholder, while keeping the principal emblem readable at `10x7`. Prefer a layered civic, heraldic, industrial, botanical, maritime, or institutional emblem with a clear outer silhouette over an isolated circle, star, arrow, stripe, or geometric blob.

Avoid generated text unless the design absolutely requires it and the final output is manually checked.

Always use `$imagegen` for every new flag, including historically attested and real-world designs. Historical research still comes first: save and cite a reliable design reference, then use it as an image input and strict design constraint for imagegen. The generated result must be a clean, flat flag reconstruction, not an illustration of a flag. Reject waving fabric, folds, flagpoles, skies, lighting, gradients, painterly texture, vignettes, fake lettering, invented seals, perspective, shadows, or any scene around the flag. Manually compare geometry, colour fields, symbol count, symbol orientation, and heraldic details with the cited reference before resizing it. Imagegen is not permission to reinterpret a documented historical design.

For existing countries that already have game-provided or repository-approved base flags, do not replace the no-suffix base flag as part of an ideology pass. Keep the base flag unchanged, or restore it from the approved prior asset if an asset pass damaged it, unless the user explicitly asks for that base flag to be redone or the country receives a deliberate focus/event/cosmetic-tag transformation. Ideology variants should be separate assets for `_communism`, `_democratic`, `_fascism`, and `_neutrality`, not mutations of the base flag with one small shape, a palette swap, a color filter, a vertical flip, or a copied emblem.

For focus-tree or event route flag changes, use explicit cosmetic tags or route-specific flag files and document the trigger/focus that changes the flag. Do not create default flag overrides or new base flags for vanilla-supported or already-existing countries just because they participate in an event.

Historical or historically grounded flags must use sourced motifs, documented heraldry, period symbols, or clearly explained alternate-history synthesis. If no directly attested flag exists, state that in the manifest and produce a historically grounded design from relevant motifs instead of inventing unrelated symbols.

Generated fictional or alternate-history flag variants must come from a separate `$imagegen` result for each visually distinct design and then be processed into final flag sizes. Preserve the generated emblem geometry, internal heraldic construction, and identifying details through export. Do not replace the generated design with local rectangles, circles, stars, arrows, traced silhouettes, or other programmatically drawn geometry. Do not use a solid-fill normalizer, aggressive palette quantizer, vector trace, or edge simplifier that reduces generated detail to primitive shapes. Mechanical cropping, colour management, edge cleanup, orientation correction, resizing, and TGA export are allowed, but they must not become the source of the design.

Keep the full ImageGen source master and create a comparison sheet containing that master plus the normal, medium, and small exports. Reject a flag when its normal export no longer contains the distinctive generated emblem or when its small export reads as an accidental blob. Flags are designs/assets, not event artwork: the source and final files must still be flat, orthographic flag graphics without fabric, folds, a flagpole, a scene, perspective, lighting, shadows, or painterly surface texture.

Before marking any flag complete, verify normal, medium, and small TGA files:

- normal: 82x52
- medium: 41x26
- small: 10x7
- correct visual orientation in a contact sheet
- TGA origin/header convention consistent with vanilla HOI4 flags, `file` output must not show `- top`
- no byte-identical ideology variants unless the design is intentionally shared and documented
- no upside-down copies
- no accidental no-suffix base-flag replacement for countries that were only meant to receive ideology variants

## 21. Country-leader, commander, operative, and named-officeholder portraits

`chaosx_portrait_creator` owns every portrait from source/brief through runtime handoff. Grounded portraits use an attributed unchanged source and the selected `source_placeholder` or explicitly requested `styled_final` mode; fictional/impossible portraits use native ImageGen. Automated checks never replace independent visual review.

Run the automatic source package tool from the mod root (or pass `--crop` for measured recovery):

```powershell
python -B .agents/skills/chaos-redux-event-assets/tools/extract_portrait_source_crop.py `
	<archival_master.jpg> <subject_source_crop.png>
```

Automatic mode uses bundled YuNet to require exactly one face, computes a portrait-aspect head-and-shoulders crop, saves the untouched original, exact lossless crop, `156x210` RGB PNG, JSON equality/model/hash evidence, and a co-located provenance `.txt` contract under `docs/assets/portraits/<event_id>_<event_slug>/` (subject subfolders are allowed). Missing model/OpenCV support, zero/multiple faces, unsafe geometry, or write collisions fail closed; use `--model` or an explicit `--crop` recovery. Both routes write the complete package; manual JSON is labelled `manual_crop_override` and reports no face box or YuNet detection. The JSON must retain source/crop/processed dimensions, hashes, exact crop coordinates, equality result, and normalized command (plus detector evidence only for automatic mode). Never accept an alternate crop without equivalent decoded-pixel equality evidence.

Convert and wire the processed PNG as `source_placeholder` when selected. `replacement_pending` is allowed only after an explicit styled-final request remains outstanding; when supplied, the user-provided output goes to `chaosx_portrait_creator` for independent validation, DDS conversion, and replacement at the same runtime path. Never operate RunPod.

Before DDS conversion, keep the untouched original, lossless crop, processed PNG, JSON, and provenance contract together under the exact runtime basename. The archive never replaces source evidence and never becomes a runtime reference.

Choose the canonical reference family by role before starting:

- country leader: `portraits/leaders/`
- army or navy commander: `portraits/commanders/`
- operative: `portraits/operatives/`
- named officeholder: the canonical family owned by its consuming leader, commander, operative, advisor, or high-command surface

Use role-specific references as style controls only, never as a face source. Compare unchanged master, exact crop, deterministic candidate, any supplied provider output, runtime candidate, and references at native size and ≥4x nearest-neighbour.

Preserve facial geometry, asymmetry, age, expression, hair, pose, and source-visible clothing; reject genericization, beautification, symmetrization, face substitution, invented detail, unsupported insignia, weak likeness, or filtered photos. Record source URL/attribution/license, original and crop hashes/coordinates, processed/provider/runtime hashes, role references, comparison sheet, reviewer/date, separate likeness/framing/provenance verdicts, mode/state, DDS path, sprite, and gender/name-pool metadata. Missing evidence blocks the portrait.

For fictional or impossible characters classified as `fictional_high_chaos`, `chaosx_portrait_creator` uses native ImageGen and completes the portrait package. Grounded identities use the sourced gate above; if no defensible source exists, mark the portrait `blocked`.

Country-leader, commander, operative, and named-officeholder candidates are deterministic `156x210` portraits; commander references remain full `156x210` even when displayed smaller. Advisor/high-command cards use section 21.1's separate native `65x67` workflow after the shared identity gate. Operatives use the full pipeline and cataloged owning sprite.

## Chaos Redux portrait production gate

Every portrait follows `.agents/skills/chaos-redux-comfyui/SKILL.md`: grounded source-placeholder or explicitly requested provider-backed styled-final branch, fictional/impossible native ImageGen branch, and the separate no-advisor-icons authorization boundary in section 21.1.

## 21.1 Advisor and high-command portrait icons

Advisor, theorist, military-high-command, and officer-corps portrait icons are a separate asset type.
Inspect `assets/vanilla_reference/portraits/advisors/` before work.
The final target is native `65x67`, with a recognisable HOI4-styled head-and-shoulders portrait, a dark irregular dossier frame where the approved reference family uses one, and transparent outer corners.
Do not infer this family from a character or small-portrait consumer, it must be present in the accepted requirement set.

Apply the section 3 source-mode gate to the advisor or high-command subject: grounded, historical, restored, separatist, regional, indigenous, dynastic, or otherwise plausibly historical identities use sourced real people, while generated one-person subjects are limited to truly fictional high-chaos or impossible/supernatural entities.
Missing or contradictory classification fails closed.
For a fictional subject in the allowed class, `chaosx_portrait_creator` uses native ImageGen to create a distinct full-resolution portrait master; never reuse a leader crop.
For real people, complete the shared source and provenance gate before preparing the native card, section 21 governs the portrait handoff and fallback.
Institutional or collective briefs must state whether the result is people-free or includes a governing group, never imply that invented faces are sourced historical individuals.

Keep a repo-contained provenance manifest for every native card.
Record the source mode, source and candidate hashes and dimensions, exact crop or composition notes, generation or editing inputs, attribution or ImageGen record, reviewer, date, and runtime path.
Keep each source, processed PNG, review sheet, and metadata file in a distinct path, do not split out or bypass an individual source to weaken provenance.

Use `.agents/skills/chaos-redux-event-assets/tools/create_advisor_icon.py` for native `65x67` advisor-template composition. Use the canonical `portraits/advisors/advisor_template.png` as one exact, untouched top layer rather than reconstructing its frame, paper, or shadows from separate elements. Load the complete approved source canvas without pre-cropping or pre-warping it. Measure the opening center, rotated width and height, and angle from the actual template; canonical cards must use that exact opening-fill plane, match the angle within `0.05` degrees, and use a `0 0` center offset. Use one shared uniform scale factor, `max(opening_width / source_width, opening_height / source_height)`, to cover the measured opening while preserving the source aspect ratio exactly, then center the scaled portrait behind the opening. Do not anisotropically resize, add a matte or padded strip, or crop before scaling. Only the narrow symmetric excess caused by the mismatched aspect ratio may be clipped after scaling by the unchanged opening safety mask, then composite the untouched template on top. `source_pre_crop=false` means no pre-scale source crop; it does not mean that post-scale frame clipping is absent. Generate and retain a separate placement study for every person and inspect the face, head, and shoulders at native size and `4x`. The alignment overlay must show the measured opening in red, the opening-fill plane in green, and the uniformly scaled covering portrait in yellow; yellow may extend beyond green only by the recorded symmetric frame clip. The selected transform must match the retained study candidate. Near-zero rotation is rejected by default; use the explicit override only for an independently reviewed alternative template whose measured opening is actually unrotated. Retain transform and hash metadata for the source, template, measured opening geometry, selected placement, `opening_fill_size`, `covering_content_size`, `covering_content_center`, `frame_clip_pixels`, and the explicit fit flags `source_pre_crop=false`, `frame_clip=true`, and `stretch=false`, plus study, alignment overlay, processed PNG, and runtime DDS. QA must prove that every opening-mask pixel has source coverage, that no transparent, black, matte, or padded gap remains, and that subject scale is comparable to the vanilla advisor/high-command references at native and `4x` review size. The reusable command contract and review checklist are documented under `tools/README.md` in the advisor and high-command dossier section.

Do not shrink, pad, or directly wire a `156x210` leader, commander, or operative portrait.
Compose the subject independently inside the native card with a deterministic, task-specific/manual workflow and retain the exact crop, face placement, dimensions, hashes, and review evidence.
Do not draw replacement frame, paper, seal, bevel, patina, emblem, writing, or shadow artwork from primitive geometry, and do not advertise a missing shared processor.

Check the native `65x67` candidate against the canonical advisor and high-command references.
Confirm composition, face readability, frame silhouette and palette, paper geometry and opacity where present, transparent corners, texture continuity, and the absence of holes or fringe.
Record any deterministic dimension or alpha checks as evidence, but treat visual approval as a separate human gate.

When a character explicitly defines a `portraits = { army = { small = ... } }` sprite, the small slot remains a native `65x67` dossier portrait while `army.large` remains the full `156x210` commander portrait.
Do not create a plain `50x67` resize or crop for the army-small slot, and do not replace or downsize the approved full commander texture.
Keep the large and small sprite names stable, record both runtime paths and provenance, and validate both textures separately.

The independent visual review must compare the candidate with the canonical advisor and high-command references at native `65x67` and at `4x` nearest-neighbour size.
Automated dimension and alpha checks produce evidence only, and the producer cannot self-approve the candidate.
Convert only an independently approved PNG with `python -B .agents/skills/chaos-redux-event-assets/tools/convert_to_dds.py --input <approved.png> --output <runtime.dds> --width 65 --height 67`.


## Animated leader portraits

Leader portraits can be animated for special routes, high-chaos leaders, supernatural leaders, rare formables, major transformations, or dramatic council reveals. They should not be required for every normal country leader.

Animated leader portrait packages must include:

- static fallback portrait
- animated sheet or frame source
- final DDS files
- final sprite names
- character or leader key that will use the portrait
- source mode and source documentation
- whether the leader is real, fictional, symbolic, collective, supernatural, or alternate-history
- note on motion type, such as glow, smoke, flicker, eye-light, flag shadow, slow breathing, office light, map projection, or particle drift

## 22. UI panels and custom windows

For UI panels, investigation windows, ledgers, and similar assets, separate artwork from functional UI.

Use `$imagegen` for:

- illustrated background panels
- thematic decorations
- symbolic seals
- propaganda visuals
- report board visual elements

Use normal UI editing for:

- exact layout slicing
- cropping
- button states
- state variants
- meter fills
- final export preparation

Do not let generated art decide exact interactive layout.

The implementation must still follow HOI4 UI rules and existing repo patterns.

## Decision category and scripted GUI visual packs

Do not build a full scripted GUI visual pack for every important category. First follow the presentation hierarchy in `chaos-redux-decisions-missions`. A simple category may need only its small icon and one static or animated category picture.

When a full scripted GUI or mechanic window is justified, the asset handoff should cover the interface state set that the actual mechanic uses. Do not create unused tabs, button states, meters, frames, or decorative controls only to fill the background.

Useful assets can include:

- category icon
- category header plate
- background panel
- tab buttons
- normal, hover, selected, locked, disabled, and warning button states
- progress bars and fill variants
- meter frames
- target cards
- status seals
- warning overlays
- animated glow overlays
- animated particle overlays
- animated float emblems
- static fallback for every animated element
- tooltip icon set
- close and open buttons
- mechanic-specific leader, council, or envoy portrait

The asset prompt should state which sprites are decorative and which represent mechanic state. State-driven sprites need clear names that match the mechanic value or route state.

## 23. Progression-state variants

Progression-state variants may include:

- selected
- dim
- active
- inactive
- locked
- completed
- rejected
- damaged
- corrupted
- urgent
- meter-fill
- bar-fill

Progression-state variants should use the same target size as the base asset.

## Formable state-puzzle visual assets

When a formable uses the reusable state-puzzle presentation from `chaos-redux-decisions-missions`, the asset package must preserve exact state geometry and one shared geographic projection.

Each puzzle package should include:

- a state manifest with formable id, state id, state name, alternate requirement group, counting rule, source map data, projection bounds, anchor, and proposed sprite name
- one exact mask or sprite region for every required state
- a grey unmet state and a green qualifying state, or a verified frame or tint system that produces the same result without losing state boundaries
- borders, texture, labels, or another non-colour distinction between unmet and qualifying states
- a composed preview showing the full territory assembled in real geographic positions
- hover and tooltip region notes for every state piece
- a static category-picture version when the category only needs a territorial overview
- final runtime paths, `.gfx` ownership, GUI ownership, and manifest coverage

State shapes must be derived from the installed map's state and province geometry. Do not trace a screenshot by hand, generate borders with ImageGen, simplify the pieces into generic tiles, or substitute a modern political map. All pieces must use one projection, scale, origin, edge treatment, and border width.

A generated or sourced background may frame the map, but it must not alter, cover, or replace the exact state shapes. Keep the territorial layer readable at supported resolutions and verify that neighbouring states meet cleanly without unexplained gaps or overlaps.

Choose one verified runtime structure based on the consumer:

- separate state sprites
- one atlas with documented frame order
- one sheet with documented frame order
- exact mask layers over a shared base

Do not choose a structure only because it is easier to export. The GUI and dynamic eligibility logic must be able to address each required state reliably.

The reusable implementation templates belong under:

`.agents/skills/chaos-redux-decisions-missions/templates/formable_state_puzzle/`

The asset handoff must match the template manifest and naming rules. Skill-local template assets are reference scaffolding and must never be runtime consumers.

## Formable nation asset coverage

Every formable nation needs visible identity assets.

Asset planning should cover:

- formable flag in normal, medium, and small sizes
- ideology variants where relevant
- cosmetic-tag flags where relevant
- leader portrait or council portrait
- animated leader portrait when the formable is a rare dramatic route
- focus icons for the formation route
- decision icon for the formation decision
- a static or animated decision category picture when a territorial overview or formation identity would improve the category
- exact state-puzzle GUI assets when formation progress depends on current control of named states
- news, report, or super-event image if the formation is globally important
- faction emblem if the formable creates a league, empire, federation, bloc, mandate, compact, or coalition
- achievement icon if the formable has achievement hooks

Historical or culturally attested formable symbols need source review. Fictional, alternate-history, supernatural, and high-chaos variants may use generated art with clear manifest notes.


## Animated sprites, scripted GUI assets, and animated portraits

Use `chaos-redux-frame-animation` for every final animated visual asset. Some Chaos Redux mechanics should have animated visual layers when motion improves readability, atmosphere, or feedback. Examples include floating seals, glowing route emblems, particle drift, meter pulses, warning frames, active-button glows, occult pressure effects, sponsor influence networks, and final formable proclamations.

Animated leader portraits should be handled as major identity assets. Complete section 21 through `chaosx_portrait_creator` before frame animation for both grounded and fictional subjects. The asset handoff must say whether the animation is subtle, such as breathing light or smoke, or symbolic, such as eye glow, map shadow, glitch, or spectral overlay. The portrait should still read clearly at in-game size.

Final animated assets must be built from planned source frames. Do not create final animation by taking one still image and shifting, scaling, rotating, warping, blurring, recoloring, brightening, or pulsing it with a script. Local scripts may normalize, align, crop, resize, assemble sheets, create previews, and convert frames after the real frames exist.

## 24. DDS conversion

Final PNG assets must be converted to DDS using the repository's standard DDS conversion workflow. The converter lives only at `.agents/skills/chaos-redux-event-assets/tools/convert_to_dds.py`, `.tools/convert_to_dds.py` is obsolete, and active skills, agents, scripts, and handoffs must not restore or call it.

The output must be compatible with Chaos Redux's expected 32-bit BGRA or B8G8R8A8-style DDS workflow.

Run the bundled converter from the mod root:

```powershell
python -B .agents/skills/chaos-redux-event-assets/tools/convert_to_dds.py --input <processed.png> --output <final.dds> [--width <pixels> --height <pixels>]
```

If a retained custom mechanical processor must write uncompressed BGRA DDS directly, mirror that converter's `write_bgra_dds` layout exactly instead of inventing another header layout.

For a standard legacy, one-level, uncompressed BGRA DDS, require all of the following:

- a 128-byte file header in total: `DDS ` magic at byte 0, `DDS_HEADER` size `124` at byte 4, and 11 reserved dwords before the pixel-format block
- `DDS_PIXELFORMAT` at byte 76 with size `32`, flags `65` (`RGB | ALPHAPIXELS`), fourCC `0`, bit count `32`, and BGRA masks `0x00FF0000`, `0x0000FF00`, `0x000000FF`, and `0xFF000000`
- `DDSCAPS_TEXTURE` (`0x1000`) at byte 108
- no mipmaps unless the target asset deliberately requires them

Validate each uncompressed one-level BGRA output by checking the declared width and height, exact file length `128 + width * height * 4`, actual alpha-byte minimum and maximum against the asset's intended transparency, and successful registration of the final path in `.gfx`. Dimension and alpha checks alone are insufficient: reject shifted pixel-format blocks, missing texture caps, or any other malformed header even when an image decoder can report plausible dimensions.

If a processing script is retained as provenance, rerun it after correcting its DDS writer and validate every DDS it produces, not only the asset that exposed the defect.

If conversion fails, stop and report the error. Do not invent another conversion route unless the user approves it.

After conversion, confirm that:

- the DDS exists
- the dimensions are correct
- the background is transparent for icons
- the filename is stable
- the file is in the correct mod folder, including the event-scoped folder or documented root-only exception
- the `.gfx` path points to the DDS
- the manifest records the final path

For small icon, counter, and emblem packages, decode each final DDS back to pixels at its native size and retain the round-trip comparison evidence with the contact sheet. A header, dimension, and alpha pass alone is not visual QA.

Do not leave only PNG files when the game expects DDS.

## 25. `.gfx` handoff and main-agent wiring

Asset subagents do not edit `.gfx` files by default.

When an asset needs a sprite definition, the asset package must include a handoff note for the main agent.

Recommended path while the event asset workspace is active:

```text
docs/assets/<event_id>_<event_slug>/gfx_handoff.md
```

The handoff must include:

1. Final DDS path.
2. Proposed sprite name or the exact sprite name already provided by the parent.
3. Suggested target `.gfx` file.
4. Ready-to-copy sprite definition snippet when useful.
5. Related localisation key, GUI element, event id, focus id, idea id, decision id, achievement id, or super-event slot when known.
6. Any uncertainty about sprite naming or target file placement.
7. Any blocked or needs-review asset.

If the main agent already registered `.gfx` sprites or texture paths before requesting art, the asset subagent must follow those filenames, sprite names, DDS paths, and target sizes exactly. It should only propose names or paths when they were not provided.

The main agent then:

1. Finds the correct existing `.gfx` file if one exists.
2. Follows the existing naming and formatting pattern.
3. Adds the sprite definition.
4. Points the texture file to the final DDS path.
5. Keeps sprite names stable.
6. Updates localisation, GUI, event, focus, idea, or decision references that use the sprite.
7. Updates docs and spreadsheet rows when relevant.

When wiring event-owned sprite-backed art, the texture path should point to the event-scoped folder for that asset category. If an asset must stay root-only, document the engine reason in the handoff or manifest.

Do not create a new `.gfx` file if an existing one is clearly the right place. If a new `.gfx` file is needed, the main agent must name it consistently and document why.

`gfx_handoff.md` is temporary evidence while the event asset workspace is active. Before the event goal is fully complete, copy any durable sprite, path, ownership, and uncertainty facts into the event or plan documentation that remains after cleanup, then delete the event-scoped workspace with the rest of `docs/assets/<event_id>_<event_slug>/`.

## 26. Documentation updates

When generated or sourced assets are part of an event or mechanic, update the relevant docs.

The docs should mention:

- what assets exist
- where the DDS files live
- which `.gfx` file the main agent should use or has used
- which sprite names are used or proposed
- which assets are placeholders, if any
- what still needs final art, if anything

Do not leave the docs describing old or missing assets.

## 27. Contact sheets

When an asset package contains many generated or sourced images, create a contact sheet for review.

Small template, facility, unit, counter, and emblem packages always require a native-size contact sheet, even when the package contains one final asset.

Contact sheets are for review only.

The canonical decision category picture reference family always requires:

`assets/vanilla_reference/icons/decision_categories/pictures/contact_sheet.png`

Create or refresh that sheet whenever reference images are added, removed, renamed, or replaced. Show filenames and native dimensions. Record user-provided reference images as user-provided in the catalog and do not treat them as runtime-ready assets.

Do not use contact sheets as final game assets.

The contact sheet should make it easy to see:

- asset name
- asset type
- selected final version
- rejected alternatives if relevant

For the small-icon and counter contract, the sheet must also show the native ImageGen source, processed transparency, enlarged smooth preview, and decoded DDS round-trip with dimensions, frame labels, and visible-bounds notes.

## 28. Handling blocked assets

If an asset cannot be created or processed cleanly, mark it as blocked.

Record:

- asset name
- reason blocked
- what was attempted
- what is needed from the user
- whether implementation can continue without it

Do not invent a substitute asset unless the user explicitly approves it.

## 29. Final checklist

Before finishing, confirm:

1. The requirement-to-runtime coverage crosswalk accounts for every accepted spec, manifest-plan, and animation-plan row, with no extra asset counted as a substitute without an explicit accepted design amendment.
2. Every asset uses the correct source mode. `chaosx_portrait_creator` handles grounded portraits through section 21 and fictional or impossible portraits through native ImageGen. Missing or unsupported classification fails closed.
3. The matching reference folder from section 4 was inspected before generation, sourcing, processing, or wiring.
4. During active work, every generated, sourced, or provided asset has a retained source PNG in the temporary workspace, with durable provenance recorded before cleanup.
5. During active work, every final asset has a processed PNG preview in the temporary workspace, with the final runtime path and relevant QA facts recorded before cleanup.
6. Every final asset has a DDS output.
7. DDS files use 32 bit unsigned BGRB 8.8.8.8.
8. DDS files are moved into the correct mod folders.
9. During active work, a `gfx_handoff.md` exists for every asset that needs a sprite definition, and the main agent has enough information to wire it. Before cleanup, durable wiring facts are copied into permanent docs.
10. During active work, the asset manifest and requirement-to-runtime crosswalk exist and are current. At fully complete state, their durable facts have been promoted and the temporary workspace has been deleted.
11. Internet-sourced assets record source links, source date or estimated date range, license or public domain status if available, and era-fit notes for World War II-era assets.
12. Fictional or non-human portraits created through native ImageGen are clearly marked as `fictional_high_chaos` or impossible/supernatural in the manifest, show a memorable internally coherent invented motif, and contain no generic, modern, meme, gore, mocking, stereotyped, or caricatured treatment. Grounded identities never use a generated officeholder, if sourcing fails, the leader portrait is `blocked`.
13. Decision category pictures are classified separately from small category icons, scripted GUI backgrounds, and full mechanic-window assets.
14. The canonical `icons/decision_categories/pictures/` reference folder and its labeled contact sheet were inspected for every category-picture package.
15. Any missing canonical category-picture contact sheet was created and the reference README and catalog were updated with filenames, native dimensions, provenance, and surface ownership.
16. Simple categories were not expanded into full scripted GUI asset packs when a static or animated category picture was sufficient.
17. Every formable state-puzzle asset uses exact installed-map state geometry, one shared projection, grey and green qualification states with non-colour cues, clean neighbouring edges, and a manifest aligned with the reusable template.
18. Docs are updated where relevant.
19. The event implementation or parent handoff knows which sprite names to use.
20. No final asset remains only in a temporary folder.
21. Every icon family in section 5.2 was treated as its own asset type, and no UI surface was satisfied by resizing, cropping, recoloring, padding, relabeling, or lightly editing an icon made for another surface.
22. Every animated asset used `chaos-redux-frame-animation`, has real source frames, has a static fallback, has no transform-only final motion, and proves its animation family's purpose and direction or state semantics rather than only its frame count.
23. Every uncompressed one-level BGRA DDS passes the complete legacy-header, exact-length, declared-dimension, actual-alpha, and `.gfx` path checks from section 24.
24. Every grounded character portrait passes section 21 with an unchanged original, co-located lossless pre-resize crop, JSON equality/model evidence, `156x210` candidate, provenance `.txt` contract, independent identity/framing/provenance review, and correct DDS/runtime evidence. `source_placeholder` is valid when explicitly selected; `replacement_pending` is honest only after an explicit styled-final request remains outstanding, while `styled_final` requires validated provider output and independent review. Commander textures are full `156x210`, never fabricated `50x67` sources. An illustration cannot serve as the identity master, and a crop without exact decoded-pixel equality evidence fails this checklist.
25. Every flag has visible imagegen source evidence, and historical flags also have a cited design reference plus a documented geometry/colour/symbol comparison. No final flag is a fabric scene or painterly flag artwork.
26. Every unit visual is classified by domain and surface as equipment/technology art, a large land counter, a land/air/naval map counter, a division-template emblem, or a land/air/naval 3D model package, one pipeline was not resized or relabeled to substitute for another. A 3D package also proves the one-image Meshy input rule, provider lineage, vanilla scale calibration, PDX material mapping, topology repair, required skeletal actions, `.mesh`/`.anim` reimport, hash-aware runtime synchronization, parent-owned wiring, and a live consumer.
27. Every strip, indexed icon family, counter, and multi-state asset preserves the cataloged frame order, frame count, per-frame footprint, and owning definition.
28. When the event goal is complete, the temporary event asset workspace is absent, while `docs/assets/portraits/<event_id>_<event_slug>/` retains every sourced portrait under its runtime basename. No runtime reference points into the archive.
29. Every small template, facility, unit, counter, and emblem asset has exact installed-vanilla consumer and reference-family evidence, a distinct built-in ImageGen source prompt and PNG, approved chroma-key-to-alpha processing, smooth native-canvas scaling, visible-bounds and footprint checks, decoded DDS round-trip evidence, and parent contact-sheet review without fallback or silent old-candidate synchronization.
30. Large land counters and division-template emblems obey the separate canvases, frame semantics, footprints, palettes, and role-differentiation contract in section 9.1.
