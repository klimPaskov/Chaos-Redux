## Core Event System

### Overview

Chaos Redux introduces an event system with a sophisticated, dynamic event firing mechanism that adapts to player actions, world state, and previous events.
List of all the existing and upcoming events can be found here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A-N5TvU9Ed_xDW4YFG75RvzTIhdA5Hc0f5YyO3qi0Ik/edit?usp=sharing

### Key Features

- **Dynamic Event Weights**: Events become rarer after firing, recovering slowly over time
- **Intelligent Timing**: Major events fire based on minor event accumulation
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: System responds to world tension, stability, and chaos levels
- **Memory**: System tracks all fired events and adjusts future probabilities

---

## Smart Event Firing Logic

### Weight-Based System

Instead of pure randomness, events have **weight values** that determine firing probability:

- **Initial Weight**: 1000 (default for new events)
- **Weight Recovery**: +40 per month after firing
- **Weight Caps**: Individual caps per event, reduced by 25% each firing
- **Minimum Weight**: 1 (repeatable events can always fire, but become more rare)

### Event Selection Process

1. **Weight Calculation**: System calculates total weight of all eligible events
2. **Random Selection**: Weighted random selection picks an event
3. **Firing Logic**: Selected event fires and triggers appropriate handlers
4. **Weight Adjustment**: Fired event's weight drops, others remain unchanged

### Major vs Minor Event Logic

- **Minor Events**: Build up "pressure" in the system
- **Major Events**: Fire when enough minor events have occurred
- **Pressure Calculation**: Major event weight = (minor events since last major) Ã— 100
- **Reset Mechanism**: Major event firing resets the minor event counter

---

## Dynamic Timer System

### Overview

The Dynamic Timer System replaces fixed monthly event timers with a daily, adaptive timer that responds to the types of events that have recently fired.

### Core Timer Mechanics

#### Initial Timer

- **Startup Range**: 7-30 days (random on game initialization)
- **Daily Check**: Timer decrements by 1 each day
- **Event Firing**: When timer reaches 0, the event selection process triggers

#### Base Timer Range

- **Minimum Days**: 20 (configurable via `global.timer_min_days`)
- **Maximum Days**: 30 (configurable via `global.timer_max_days`)
- **Default Range**: Events fire every 20-30 days under normal conditions

### Timer Modifiers

#### Minor Event Acceleration

When a minor event fires:

1. **Day Decrement Increase**: Adds +1 to decrement value (max: 15)
2. **Faster Next Event**: Subsequent timer will be reduced by current decrement
3. **Cumulative Effect**: Each minor event makes the next event fire sooner

#### Max Cap Reduction

Every 3 minor events that fire:

1. **Max Cap Reduction**: Reduces timer maximum by 1 day (max reduction: 5 days)
2. **Range Compression**: Timer range becomes more compressed over time
3. **Minimum Protection**: Range never goes below realistic values

#### Major Event Reset

When a major event fires:

1. **Full Reset**: Both day decrement and max cap reduction reset to 0
2. **Normal Timing**: Next event returns to standard 20-30 day range
3. **Fresh Start**: System returns to baseline behavior

### Example Timer Progression

#### Normal Progression

1. **Game Start**: Timer = 7-30 days (random)
2. **First Event**: Timer = 20-30 days (normal range)
3. **After Minor Event**: Timer = 19-29 days (decrement = 1)
4. **After 2nd Minor**: Timer = 18-28 days (decrement = 2)
5. **After 3rd Minor**: Timer = 17-26 days (decrement = 3, max reduced by 1)

#### Maximum Acceleration

After 15 minor events and max reductions:

- **Timer Range**: 20-25 days (base range with -5 max reduction)
- **Day Decrement**: -15 days
- **Effective Range**: 5-10 days between events
- **Result**: Very frequent event firing during chaotic periods

### Timer Variables

All timer behavior is controlled by global variables that can be modified:

- `global.timer_min_days`: Minimum timer range (default: 20)
- `global.timer_max_days`: Maximum timer range (default: 30)
- `global.timer_day_decrement`: Current day reduction (max: 15)
- `global.timer_max_cap_reduction`: Max range reduction (max: 5)
- `global.event_timer_days`: Current countdown timer

### Debug Information

The debug system tracks all timer-related information:

- Current timer countdown
- Timer range settings
- Current modifiers
- Timer calculation details

## Event Categories

### 1. Fire-Once Events

- **Behavior**: Fire exactly once per game
- **Weight After Firing**: 0 (permanently disabled)

### 2. Repeatable Events

- **Behavior**: Can fire multiple times with decreasing frequency
- **Weight After Firing**: 1 (minimum), recovers to reduced cap
- **Cap Reduction**: 25% per firing

### 3. Major Events

- **Behavior**: Fire based on minor event accumulation
- **Initial Weight**: 0 (inactive until triggered)
- **Trigger Condition**: Sufficient minor events fired

## Chaos Meter (Danger Scaling)

### Concept

A global "Danger Meter" (0-1000+) that affects event firing patterns and enables special mechanics.

### Danger Level Tiers

#### 0-199: Calm World

- **Event Behavior**: Normal firing logic
- **Available Events**: Standard event pool
- **Special Mechanics**: None active
- **World State**: Usually peaceful, stable

#### 200-499: Rising Tension

- **Event Behavior**: Increased major event chances
- **Available Events**: More negative/challenging events
- **Special Mechanics**: Event probability modifiers active
- **World State**: Mounting pressure, political instability

#### 500-799: Instability

- **Event Behavior**: Weird/unexpected event spikes
- **Available Events**: Bizarre and dangerous events unlock
- **Special Mechanics**: Events evolve, cluster events
- **World State**: Reality becoming unstable

#### 800-1000: Chaos Tier

- **Event Behavior**: Event chains stack and compound
- **Available Events**: Major world-affecting events
- **Special Mechanics**: Full event evolution
- **World State**: World order collapsing

#### 1000+: World Collapse

- **Event Behavior**: Apocalyptic scenarios
- **Available Events**: 1984 scenario, alien invasions, supernatural events
- **Special Mechanics**: All systems active
- **World State**: Complete societal collapse. No turning back.

### Danger Meter Influences

**Increases Chaos:**

- High world tension
- Low national stability
- Active wars
- Previous major events
- Population suffering

**Decreases Chaos:**

- Diplomatic successes
- Peace agreements
- Economic prosperity
- High stability
- International cooperation

---

## Event Evolution System

Events can transform into more dangerous versions when the Chaos Meter is high enough.

### Evolution Triggers

Event must reach required danger level. Some evolutions require specific previous events

---

## Event Clusters

Instead of single events, multiple related events can fire in sequence. They are based on chance. The higher the danger level, more likely these event clusters will happen.

---

## Multiplayer Compatibility

- **Shared Pools**: Every player shares one event system
- **Synchronized Chaos**: Chaos Meter affects all players

---

## Event Chain Timers (Mini-Narratives)

### Concept

Events that create ongoing storylines with timed follow-ups based on player choices.

### Example Chain: "Mysterious Disappearance"

1. **Initial Event**: "General [Name] Disappears"

   - **Player Ignores**: Timer starts (30-90 days)
   - **Player Investigates**: Different chain path

2. **Follow-up Event**: "General Reappears with Rebel Army"
   - **Conditions**: If ignored + timer expired
   - **Consequences**: Civil war or uprising
   - **Severity**: Based on Chaos Meter level

### Chain Mechanics

- **Timer Systems**: Events schedule future events
- **Choice Memory**: System remembers player decisions
- **Branching Paths**: Different choices lead to different outcomes
- **Escalation**: Ignored problems become worse over time
