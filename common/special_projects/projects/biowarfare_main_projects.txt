# # What is a Project ?
# Special projects are about researching projects in Facilities to get equipment and other bonuses.
# Special projects are divided in several Specializations. Each Specialization has a tree of researchable projects.
# One entry in this DB is one node in those trees.

# # Phases of a Project

# Researching a Project is divided in several phases.

# * Establishing phase :
# will need to go through that phase when start or re-starting a project
# will start from beginning of the phase if cancelled in the middle
# * Initial research phase :
# will need to go through that phase only once - if project cancelled after it's done, it won't go through it again
# if cancelled in the middle, will remember where it was
# * Prototyping phase :
# will need to go through that phase in several iterations until project is completed - once completed the Project is fully researched
# if cancelled in the middle, will remember where it was
# 	* Complexity :
# 	How much progress is gained each prototype iteration. Once reaching 100 the prototype phase is completed.
