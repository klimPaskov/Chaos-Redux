# chaosx_dynamic_triggers

This file documents reusable cross-system scripted triggers defined in `common/scripted_triggers/chaosx_dynamic_triggers.txt`. Subsystem-private APIs belong beside their owning system even when several files inside that system call them.

## Reuse guidance

Use this registry only for triggers with demonstrated call-site breadth across unrelated systems or event families. Reusable logic confined to one subsystem belongs in that subsystem's scripted-trigger files and dedicated reference documentation.
